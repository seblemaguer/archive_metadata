    "Cerevoice is a unit selection speech synthesis system produced by Cereproc Ltd. The system was used to build small and large unit selection databases using the data supplied by the Blizzard Challenge 2006. The large database system was used as a baseline system while two experimental approaches for improving the quality of the small database system were explored. 1) Synthetically generating diphones from sections of diphones in the database offline and then using them in synthesis, a process we term bulking. 2) Applying limited manual intervention based on negative feedback to improve quality, a process we term second-pass synthesis. Both techniques resulted in the small database system maintaining the quality of the larger system. We conclude that there is much room for improvement in the quality of small database systems using unit selection without the requirement for more data and that second-pass synthesis offers a potential means for training small database unit selection systems.\n"

   "abstract": [
    "In this paper, we describe the development of probabilistic corpus-based concatenative speech synthesis systems with the Blizzard Challenge 2006 speech databases. In the current probabilistic approach, unit selection is directed by contour, duration, and spectral probabilistic models for characteristics of the synthesis units. The targets for units are modeled by statistical additive models and duration targets are modeled by regression trees. Spectral targets for a unit is modeled by Gaussian mixtures on MFCC-based features. Goodness of concatenation of two units is modeled by conditional Gaussian models on MFCC-based features. Two kinds of voices for speech synthesis were developed using 1,052 and 4,273 utterances of the Blizzard Challenge 2006 speech databases.\n"

    "The present paper describes an HMM-based speech synthesis system developed by the Nitech-NAIST group for the Blizzard Challenge 2006 (Nitech-NAIST-HTS 2006). To achieve improvements over the 2005 system (Nitech-HTS 2005), new features such as MGC-LSP, MLLT, and full covariance GV pdf are investigated. Subjective listening test results show that combining mel-cepstral coefficients, MLLT and full covariance GV pdf achieved the best score and the performance of the 2006 system is significantly better than that of the 2005 system. Results of the Blizzard Challenge evaluations reveal that Nitech-NAIST-HTS 2006 is still competitive even a relatively large amount of training data is used.\n"

   "abstract": [
    "Acknowledging the lessons of Blizzard Challenge 2005 – that smooth prosodic cadence supersedes spectral resolution – but wanting a system devoid of vocoding artifacts – we introduce a hybrid trajectory-selection synthesizer. Using a parametric synthesizer to generate a pitch-synchronous sequence of F0/duration/power and spectral vectors, this trajectory serves as the target cost function for a unit selection synthesizer. The combination can unify the best attributes of two distinct categories of synthesizers, provided that the feature representation supports both. To this end, we also introduce a new perceptually-weighted harmonic representation of speech that is pitch-synchronous and retains phase information.\n"

The largest component of the system is a multi-platform unit selection speech synthesiser that uses Unicode and the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The system has been designed to be modular so that different synthesiser algorithms can be implemented in a single instance of the system, allowing for alternative techniques to be compared with the same input and target data. In this paper we discuss the algorithms used in the Jess synthesiser to produce speech, insights gained from participation in the Blizzard Challenge 2006, and our intended areas of future work.\n"

    "This paper introduces the USTC speech synthesis system for Blizzard Challenge 2006. The HMM-based parametric synthesis approach was adopted for its convenience and effectiveness in building a new voice, especially for the non-native developers. Some useful techniques were also integrated into our system, such as minimum generation error (MGE) training, phone duration modeling and linear spectral pair (LSP) based formant enhancement. The evaluation results show that the proposed system is able to synthesize speech with high naturalness and intelligibility by using either full database or only ARCTIC subset.\n"

The original XIMERA is aimed at constructing very high-quality Japanese TTS. Therefore, several modules are customized for our huge-sized Japanese speech corpora. In order to participate in the Blizzard Challenge 2006, we construct a test bed of English TTS by modifying the original XIMERA without carefully system optimizations. Results of the challenge tell us a current level of our system and clarify points to be improved. This paper also discusses techniques adopted in XIMERA compared with many others.\n"

   "abstract": [
    "When we built the unit inventory from the Blizzard corpus, three types of manual works were performed. All these works took about 12 working days of our labelers. In order to see how much benefit these manual works bring us, we performed several perceptual experiments to compare the speech generated with/without manual works. The results show that although the manual proofreading identified more than 500 word-errors, no improvement is observed in our experiment. Both manual checking of segmental boundaries and manual prosody annotations make the synthesized speech better. And the later one brings more benefit. The preference rate between the final version of the synthetic speech with limited manual works and the fully automatically processed version is 68% to 32%.\n"

    "In this paper, a corpus-based speech synthesis system KB2006 was developed using the speech database provided by Blizzard Challenge 2006. We proposed a novel unit selection method called multi-tier non-uniform unit selection in our corpus-base speech synthesis system. Non-uniform unit (NUU) in our system was defined as a unit sequences that contains one or more joint phoneme units. By using CART algorithm, NUUs with the same phoneme sequence in the inventory were clustered into different classes according to their prosody and acoustic difference. In the unit selection stage, a multi-tier NUUs selection algorithm was adopted by treating different NUUs with several criterions. With the discrimination, proper candidate units that close to the target unit can be selected for speech concatenation.\n"
