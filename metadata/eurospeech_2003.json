    "Can we use the past to predict the future? Moore's Law is a great example: performance doubles and prices halve approximately every 18 months. This trend has held up well to the test of time and is expected to continue for some time. Similar arguments can be found in speech demonstrating consistent progress over decades. Unfortunately, there are also cases where history repeats itself, as well as major dislocations, fundamental changes that invalidate fundamental assumptions. What will happen, for example, when petabytes become a commodity? Can demand keep up with supply? How much text and speech would it take to match this supply? Priorities will change. Search will become more important than coding and dictation.\n",

    "A new front-end processing scheme for robust speech recognition is proposed and evaluated on the multi-lingual Aurora 3 database. The front-end processing scheme consists of Mel-scaled spectral subtraction, speech segmentation, cepstral coefficient extraction, utterance-level frame dropping and eigenspace feature normalization. We also investigated performance on all language databases by post-processing features extracted by the ETSI advanced front-end with an additional eigenspace normalization module. This step consists in linear PCA matrix feature transformation followed by mean and variance normalization of the transformed cepstral coefficients. In speech recognition experiments, our proposed front-end yielded better than 16 percent relative error rate reduction over the ETSI front-end on the Finnish language database. Also, more than 6% in average relative error reduction was observed over all languages with the ETSI front-end augmented by eigenspace normalization.\n",

    "It is well-known that additive and channel noise cause shift and scaling in MFCC features. Empirical normalization techniques to estimate and compensate for the effects, such as cepstral mean subtraction and variance normalization, have been shown to be useful. However, these empirical estimate may not be optimal. In this paper, we approach the problem from two directions, 1) use a more robust MFCC-based features that is less sensitive to additive and channel noise and 2) propose a maximum likelihood (ML) based approach to compensate the noise effect. In addition, we proposed the use of multi-class normalization in which different normalization factors can be applied to different phonetic units. The combination of the robust features and ML normalization is particularly useful for highly mismatched condition in the Aurora 3 corpus resulting in a 15.8% relative improvement in the highly mismatched case and a 10.4% relative improvement on average over the three conditions.\n",

    "Maintaining a high level of robustness for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems is especially challenging when the background noise has a time-varying nature. We have implemented a Model-Based Feature Enhancement (MBFE) technique that not only can easily be embedded in the feature extraction module of a recogniser, but also is intrinsically suited for the removal of non-stationary additive noise. To this end we combine statistical models of the cepstral feature vectors of both clean speech and noise, using a Vector Taylor Series approximation in the power spectral domain. Based on this combined HMM, a global MMSE-estimate of the clean speech is then calculated. Because of the scalability of the applied models, MBFE is flexible and computationally feasible. Recognition experiments with this feature enhancement technique on the Aurora2 connected digit recognition task showed significant improvements on the noise robustness of the HTK recogniser.\n",

In this paper, we present a comparative study of these algorithms and report results of performance evaluation on Aurora connected digits databases. By following the protocol specified by the organizer of the Eurospeech-2003 special session on Aurora tasks, the best performance we achieved on Aurora2 database is a digit recognition error rate, averaged on all three test sets, of 5.53% and 6.28% for multi- and clean-condition training respectively. In a preliminary evaluation on Aurora3 Finnish and Spanish databases, significant performance improvement is also achieved by our approach.\n",

    "We have developed a novel approach to speech feature extraction based on a modulation model of a band-pass signal. Speech is processed by a bank of band-pass filters. At the output of the band-pass filters the signal is subjected to a log-derivative operation which naturally decomposes the band-pass signal into analytic (called (dot-)(alpha) (t) + j (hat)(dot-)(alpha) ) and anti-analytic (called (dot-)(beta) (t) + j (hat)(dot-)(beta) ) components. The average instantaneous frequency (AIF) and average log-envelope (ALE) are then extracted as coarse features at the output of each filter. Further, refined features may also be extracted from the analytic and anti-analytic components (but not done in this paper). We then evaluated the Aurora 2 task where noise corruption is synthetic. For clean training, (compared to the mel-cepstrum front end, with 3 mixture HMM back-end,) our AIF/ALE front end achieves an average improvement of 13.97% with set A and 17.92% improvement with set B and -31.72% (negative) `improvement' with set C. The overall improvement in accuracy rates for clean training is 7.97%. Although the improvements are modest, the novelty of the front-end and its potential for future enhancements are our strengths.\n",

    "In a real environment, it is essential to adapt acoustic models to variations in background noises in order to realize robust speech recognition. In this paper, we construct an extended acoustic model by combining a mismatch model with a clean acoustic model trained using only clean speech data. We assume the mismatch model conforms to a Gaussian distribution with time-varying population parameters. The proposed method adapts on-line the extended acoustic model to the unknown noises by estimating the time-varying population parameters using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gain-Adapted Hidden Markov Model (GA-HMM) decomposition method. We performed recognition experiments under noisy conditions using the AURORA2 database in order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

    "Because of recent events and as members of the scientific community working in the field of speech processing, we feel compelled to publicize our views concerning the possibility of identifying or authenticating a person from his or her voice. The need for a clear and common message was indeed shown by the diversity of information that has been circulating on this matter in the media and general public over the past year. In a press release initiated by the AFCP and further elaborated in collaboration with the SpLC ISCA-SIG, the two groups herein discuss and present a summary of the current state of scientific knowledge and technological development in the field of speaker recognition, in accessible wording for nonspecialists. Our main conclusion is that, despite the existence of technological solutions to some constrained applications, at the present time, there is no scientific process that enables one to uniquely characterize a person's voice or to identify with absolute certainty an individual from his or her voice. En raison d'evenements recents et en tant que membres de la communaute scientifique en traitement de la parole, l'AFCP et le SpLC, tous deux Groupes d'Interet Specialises de l'ISCA, ont collabore a cet article pour presenter un resume de l'etat des connaissances scientifiques et du developpement technologique en reconnaissance du locuteur, en des termes clairement accessibles a des non-specialistes. La necessite d'un message clair et commun concernant la possibilite d'identifier ou d'authentifier une personne par sa voix apparait particulierement necessaire compte-tenu de la diversite des informations qui ont circule dans les medias et dans l'opinion publique ces derniers mois. En depit de l'existence de solutions technologiques pour quelques applications dans des contextes d'utilisation tres contraints, nous tenons a affirmer qu' a l'heure actuelle, il n'existe pas de processus scientifique qui permet de caracteriser de facon unique la voix d'une personne, ou d'identifier avec certitude un individu a partir de sa voix.\n",

    "The Chinese language is not only spoken by the largest population in the world, but quite different from many western languages with a very special structure. It is not alphabetic: large number of Chinese characters are ideographic symbols and pronounced as monosyllables. The open vocabulary nature, the flexible wording structure and the tone behavior are also good examples within the special structure. It is believed that better results and performance will be obtainable in developing Chinese spoken language processing technologies, if this special structure can be taken into account. In this paper, a set of \"feature units\" for Chinese spoken language processing is identified, and the retrieval, segmentation and summarization of Chinese spoken documents are taken as examples in analyzing the use of such \"feature units\". Experimental results indicate that by careful considerations of the special structure and proper choice of the \"feature units\", significantly better performance can be achieved.\n",

    "The most popular time-frequency analysis tool, the Short-Time Fourier Transform, suffers from blurry harmonic representation when voiced speech undergoes changes in pitch. These relatively fast variations lead to inconsistent bins in frequency domain and cannot be accurately described by the Fourier analysis with high resolution both in time and frequency. In this paper a new analysis tool, called Short-Time Chirp Transform is presented, offering more precise time-frequency representation of speech signals. The base of this adaptive transform is composed of quadratic chirps that follow the pitch tendency segment-by-segment. Comparative results between the proposed STCT and popular time-frequency techniques reveal an improvement in time-frequency localization and finer spectral representation. Since the signal can be resynthesized from its STCT, the proposed method is also suitable for filtering purposes.\n",

This spectral model is based on the spectrum of the KLGLOTT88 model for the glottal source. The proposed procedure removes the glottal source from the spectrum of the speech signal in an accurate manner, particularly for high-pitched signals and singing voice, and the estimated glottal waveforms present less amount of formant ripple.

    "A new and potentially important method for predicting, analysing and comparing responses of hearing aid algorithms is studied and presented here. This method is based on a time-frequency representation (TFR) generated by a computational auditory model. Hearing impairment is simulated by a change of parameters of the auditory model. To simulate the basilar membrane (BM) filtering part of the auditory model we propose a single parameter control version of the gammachirp filterbank and for simulating the neural processing in the auditory pathway we propose a signal processing model motivated by the physiological properties of the auditory nerve. This model then interprets the information processing in the auditory pathway through the use of a TFR called the auditory TFR (A-TFR) which matches the standard spectrogram in terms of both time and frequency resolution. Two popularly used hearing aid algorithms, a two channel wide band system and a nine channel compression system, are simulated and are used to compensate the impaired auditory model. The responses of the compensated system, in terms of the acoustic-phonetics cues that characterise speech intelligibility, are analysed and compared with one another and with that of a normal auditory system. It is shown that although the nine channel compression algorithm performs better than the two channel system both the hearing aid algorithms distort severely the acoustic-phonetic cues.\n",

    "Microphone arrays are widely used to detect, locate, and track a stationary or moving speaker. The first step is to estimate the time delay, between the speech signals received by a pair of microphones. Conventional methods like generalized cross-correlation are based on the spectral content of the vocal tract system in the speech signal. The spectral content of the speech signal is affected due to degradations in the speech signal caused by noise and reverberation. However, features corresponding to the excitation source of speech are less affected by such degradations. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the time delays using the excitation source information in speech. The estimated delays are used to get the position of the moving speaker. The proposed method is compared with the spectrum-based approach using real data from a microphone array setup.\n",

    "A technique for high-accuracy tracking of formants or vocal tract resonances is presented in this paper using a novel nonlinear predictor and using a target-directed temporal constraint. The nonlinear predictor is constructed from a parameter-free, discrete mapping function from the formant (frequencies and bandwidths) space to the LPC-cepstral space, with trainable residuals. We examine in this study the key role of vocal tract resonance targets in the tracking accuracy. Experimental results show that due to the use of the targets, the tracked formants in the consonantal regions (including closures and short pauses) of the speech utterance exhibit the same dynamic properties as for the vocalic regions, and reflect the underlying vocal tract resonances. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of training the prediction-residual parameters and of incorporating the target-based constraint in obtaining high-accuracy formant estimates, especially for non-sonorant portions of speech.\n",

    "This paper presents a new Analysis-by-Synthesis (AbS) technique for joint optimization of the excitation and model parameters based on minimizing the closed loop synthesis error instead of the linear prediction error. By minimizing the synthesis error, the analysis and synthesis stages become more compatible. Using a gradient descent algorithm, LSPs for a given excitation are optimized to minimize the error between the original and the synthesized speech. Since the optimization starts from the LPC solution, the synthesis error is guaranteed to be lower than that obtained using the LPC coefficients. For the ITU G.729 codec, there is about 1dB of improvement in the segmental SNR for male and female speakers over 4 to 6 second long sentences. By adding an extra optimization step, the technique can be incorporated into the LPC, multi-pulse LPC and CELP-type speech coders.\n",

    "Voice transformation is the process of transforming the characteristics of speech uttered by a source speaker, such that a listener would believe the speech was uttered by a target speaker. In this paper we address the problem of transforming voice quality. We do not attempt to transform prosody.  Our system has two main parts corresponding to the two components of the source-filter model of speech production. The first component transforms the spectral envelope as represented by a linear prediction model. The transformation is achieved using a Gaussian mixture model, which is trained on aligned speech from source and target speakers. The second part of the system predicts the spectral detail from the transformed linear prediction coefficients. A novel approach is proposed, which is based on a classifier and residual codebooks. On the basis of a number of performance metrics it outperforms existing systems.\n",

Our approach (a) fuses measurements from independent arrays, (b) incorporates kinematic information of speakers' movement by using parallel Kalman filters, and (c) associates observations to specific speakers by using a Probabilistic Data Association (PDA) technique. We demonstrate that a network of arrays combined with statistical fusion techniques provides a consistent and coherent way to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity of measurements. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated on a simulation dealing with beamforming one moving speaker on an extended basis and localization of two closely spaced moving speakers with crossing trajectories.\n",

    "This paper proposes an integrated speech front-end for both speech recognition and speech reconstruction applications. Speech is first decomposed into a set of frequency bands by an auditory model. The output of this is then used to extract both robust pitch estimates and MFCC vectors. Initial tests used a 128 channel auditory model, but results show that this can be reduced significantly to between 23 and 32 channels. A detailed analysis of the pitch classification accuracy and the RMS pitch error shows the system to be more robust than both comb function and LPC-based pitch extraction. Speech recognition results show that the auditory-based cepstral coefficients give very similar performance to conventional MFCCs. Spectrograms and informal listening tests also reveal that speech reconstructed from the auditory-based cepstral coefficients and pitch has similar quality to that reconstructed from conventional MFCCs and pitch.\n",

In the case of AMR-NB and AMR-WB speech coders, these bit savings are 0.65-1.15 kbit/s depending on the mode. The performance of the modified AMR speech coders is verified by subjective and objective measures in error-free conditions.

    "Accurate discrimination between speech and non-speech is an essential part in many tasks of speech processing systems. In this paper an approach to the classification part of a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) is presented. Some possible shortcomings of present VAD-systems are described and a classification approach which overcomes these weaknesses is derived. This approach is based on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a neural network, which is able to detect clusters within the feature space of its training data. Training of the classifier takes place in two steps: First the SOM has to be trained. When finished, it is used in the second training step to learn the mapping between its classes and the desired output \"speech\" resp. \"non-speech\". Experiments on a database containing audio-samples obtained under different noisy conditions show the potential of the proposed algorithm.\n",

    "This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating the spectral envelope of voiced speech independently of its harmonic structure. Because of the quasi-periodicity of voiced speech, its spectrum indicates harmonic structure and only has energy at frequencies corresponding to integral multiples of F_0. It is hence impossible to identify transfer characteristics between the adjacent harmonics. In order to resolve this problem, Multi-frame Analysis (MFA) is introduced. The MFA estimates a spectral envelope using many portions of speech which are vocalised using the same vocal-tract shape. Since each of the portions usually has a different F_0 and ensuing different harmonic structure, a number of harmonics can be obtained at various frequencies to form a spectral envelope. The method thereby gives a closer approximation to the vocal-tract transfer function.\n",

The paper also proposes a new and robust noise estimation technique, which utilises a combination of the quantile-based and smoothing-based algorithms. The performance of the latter technique is then evaluated and compared to those of the above three noise estimation methods under various noise conditions. Reported results demonstrate that all four algorithms are capable of tracking both stationary and non-stationary noise adequately but with varying degree of accuracy.\n",

Since the sources for the most part do not overlap in the time-frequency domain, we get raw estimates of their individual mixing parameters with an analysis of the mixture ratios. We then obtain reliable mixing parameters by dynamically clustering these instantaneous estimates. The mixing parameters are used to separate the mixtures, even at time-frequency points where the sources overlap. In addition, even when the mixing parameters change over time, our approach is able to separate signals with only one pass through the data. We have evaluated this approach first on computer generated anechoic mixtures and then on real echoic mixtures recorded in a car.\n",

    "This paper presents a new approach for estimating voice source and vocal tract filter characteristics of voiced speech. When it is required to know the transfer function of a system in signal processing, the input and output of the system are experimentally observed and used to calculate the function. However, in the case of source-filter separation we deal with in this paper, only the output (speech) is observed and the characteristics of the system (vocal tract) and the input (voice source) must simultaneously be estimated. Hence the estimate becomes extremely difficult, and it is usually solved approximately using oversimplified models. We demonstrate that these characteristics are separable under the assumption that they are independently controlled by different factors. The separation is realised using an iterative approximation along with the Multi-frame Analysis method, which we have proposed to find spectral envelopes of voiced speech with minimum interference of the harmonic structure.\n",

    "The spectral study of the glottal excitation has traditionally been based on a single time-domain mathematical model of the signal, and the spectral dependence on its time domain parameters. Opposite to this approach, in this work the two most widely used time domain models have been studied jointly, namely the KLGLOTT88 and the LF models. Their spectra are analyzed in terms of their dependence on the general glottal source parameters: Open quotient, asymmetry coefficient and spectral tilt. As a result, it has been proved that even though the mathematical expressions for both models are quite different, they can be made to converge. The main difference found is that in the KLGLOTT88 model the asymmetry coefficient is not independent of the open quotient and the spectral tilt. Once this relationship has been identified and translated to LF model, both models are shown to be equivalent in both time and frequency domains. En este trabajo se ha analizado el espectro de la derivada de la fuente glotal. Este tipo de estudios tradicionalmente se han enfocado hacia el estudio de un determinado modelo de la fuente glotal, y como afectan los parametros temporal de dicho modelo a su espectro. Por el contrario, en este caso se pretende dar una vision mas general, y para ello se han estudiado conjuntamente dos de los modelos temporales de fuente glotal mas relevantes: el modelo KLGLOTT88 y el modelo LF. El espectro de ambos modelos ha sido estudiado en terminos de las tres caracteristicas de la fuente glotal que tiene modelar cualquier modelo matematico: el cociente de apertura, el coeficiente de asimetria y la tendencia o inclinacion espectral. Como consecuencia de este estudio se ha podido comprobar que a pesar de que las expresiones matematicas de ambos modelos son muy diferentes, la principal diferencia entre ambos reside en que en el caso del modelo KLGLOTT88 el coeficiente de asimetria viene determinado por el cociente de apertura y la tendencia espectral. Dada la relacion matematica entre los parametros se puede demostrar que en estas condiciones ambos modelos de fuente son equivalentes en el domino temporal y el dominio espectral.\n",

    "This study^1 proposes two new methods for detailed modeling and transformation of the vocal tract spectrum and the pitch contour. The first method (selective pre-emphasis) relies on band-pass filtering to perform vocal tract transformation. The second method (segmental pitch contour model) focuses on a more detailed modeling of pitch contours. Both methods are utilized in the design of a voice conversion algorithm based on codebook mapping. We compare them with existing vocal tract and pitch contour transformation methods and acoustic feature transplantations in subjective tests. The performance of the selective pre-emphasis based method is similar to the methods used in our previous work at higher sampling rates with a lower prediction order. The results also indicate that the segmental pitch contour model improves voice conversion performance.

    "In this paper, we develop improved schemes for simultaneous speech interpolation and demodulation based on continuous-time models. This leads to robust algorithms to estimate the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies of the speech resonances and extract novel acoustic features for ASR. The continuous-time models retain the excellent time resolution of the ESAs based on discrete energy operators and perform better in the presence of noise. We also introduce a robust algorithm based on the ESAs for amplitude compensation of the filtered signals. Furthermore, we use robust nonlinear modulation features to enhance the classic cepstrum-based features and use the augmented feature set for ASR applications. ASR experiments show promising evidence that the robust modulation features improve recognition.\n",

    "A robust and sensitive word boundary decision algorithm for automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is proposed. The algorithm uses a time-frequency feature to improve both robustness and sensitivity. The time-frequency features are passed through a bank of moving average filters for temporary decision of word boundary in each band. The decision results of each band are then passed through a median filter for the final decision. The adoption of time-frequency feature improves the sensitivity, while the median filtering improves the robustness. Proposed algorithm uses an adaptive threshold based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in each band which further improves the decision performance. Experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Q.Li et al's robust algorithm.\n",

    "Acoustic Shock describes a condition where sudden loud acoustic signals in communication equipment causes hearing damage and discomfort to the users. To combat this problem, a subband-based acoustic shock limiting (ASL) algorithm is proposed and implemented on an ultra low-power DSP system with an input-output latency of 6.5 msec. This algorithm processes the input signal in both the time and frequency domains. This approach allows the algorithm to detect sudden increases in sound level (time-domain), as well as frequency-selectively suppressing shock disturbances in frequency domain. The unaffected portion of the sound spectrum is thus preserved as much as possible. A simple ASL algorithm calibration procedure is proposed to satisfy different sound pressure level (SPL) limit requirements for various communication equipment. Acoustic test results show that the ASL algorithm limits acoustic shock signals to below specified SPL limits while preserving speech quality.\n",

This stage is implemented using a band-pass filter bank and phase-locked-loops cascaded to the output of each filter. A second block enhances the harmonic corresponding to the fundamental frequency and attenuates all other harmonics. Finally a third stage re-synthesizes a new signal with high energy at the fundamental frequency and extracts pitch contour from that signal using another phase locked-loop.

Several frequency band and window length selection methods based on harmonicity measure are assessed to find out better performance. It is shown that the performance of the IFAS-based estimator is maintained at constant error rate about 1% from clean speech data up to 15 dB and about 11% at 0 dB SNR.

The improvements are mainly based on the application of the continuous wavelet transform for the detection of accents and phrases in a F0 contour. A detailed explanation of the underlying idea of this approach is given and the implemented algorithm is described. Results prove that with the proposed method a significant improvement in the accuracy of the extracted parameters is achieved.

    "A recent approach to signal segmentation in additive noise [1, 2] uses features of small spectrogram sub-units accrued over the full spectrogram. The original work considered chirp signals in additive white Gaussian noise. This paper extends this work first by considering similar signals at different signal-to-noise ratios and then in the context of speech recognition. For the chirp case, a cost function based on spectrogram area is introduced and this indicates that the segmentation process is robust down to and below 0 dB SNR. For the speech experiments the objectives are again to assess the segmentation capabilities of the process. White Gaussian noise is added to clean speech and the segmentation process applied. The cost function now is automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. After segmentation speech areas are set to one constant level and non-speech areas are set to a lower constant level, thereby assessing the segmentation process and the importance of spectral shape in ASR. For the ASR experiments the TIDigits database is used in a standard AURORA 2 configuration, under mis-matched test and training conditions. With 5 dB SNR for the test set only (clean training) a word accuracy of 56% is achieved. This compares with 16% when the same noisy test data is applied directly to the ASR system without segmentation. Thus the segmentation approach shows that spectral shapes alone (without normal spectral amplitude variations) leads to perhaps surprisingly good ASR results in noisy conditions. The next stage is to include amplitude information along with appropriate noise compensation.\n",

    "Speaker turn detection is an important task for many speech processing applications. However, accurate segmentation can be hard to achieve if there are multiple concurrent speakers (overlap), as is typically the case in multi-party conversations. In such cases, the location of the speaker, as measured using a microphone array, may provide greater discrimination than traditional spectral features. This was verified in previous work which obtained a global segmentation in terms of single speaker classes, as well as possible overlap combinations. However, such a global strategy suffers from an explosion of the number of overlap classes, as each possible combination of concurrent speakers must be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we propose two alternative schemes that produce an individual segmentation decision for each speaker, implicitly handling all overlapping speaker combinations. The proposed approaches also allow straightforward online implementations. Experiments are presented comparing the segmentation with that obtained using the previous system.\n",

The main advantages of the approach are that it does not require a separate training phase or training data, is adaptive, and that the classification results are automatically smoothed because of the Markov assumption of successive phonetic events. The method is especially applicable to speech recognition.\n",

The algorithm is tested on two-speaker telephone conversations with different genders and via different telephony networks (land-line and cellular).

    "Parameter-embedded watermarking of speech signals is effected through slight perturbations of parametric models of some deeply-integrated dynamics of the signal. One of the objectives of the present research is to develop, within the parameter-embedding framework, quantifiable measures of fidelity of the stegosignal and of robustness of the watermark to attack. This paper advances previous developments on parameter-embedded watermarking by introducing a specific technique for watermark selection subject to a fidelity constraint. New results in set-theoretic filtering are used to obtain sets of allowable parameter perturbations (i.e., watermarks) subject to an l_(infinity) constraint on the error between the watermarked and original material. With respect to previous trial-and-error perturbation methods, the set-based parameter perturbation is not only quantified and systematic, it is found to be more robust, and to have a higher threshold of perceptibility with perturbation energy. After a brief review of the general parameter-embedding strategy, the new algorithm for set-theoretic watermark selection is presented. Experiments with real speech data are used to assess robustness and other performance properties. This work is being undertaken in support of the development of the National Gallery of the Spoken Word, a project of the Digital Libraries II Initiative.\n",

    "Mandarin is a syllable-timed language whose syllable structure is quite simple [1]. In spontaneous Mandarin, because of rapid speech rate the structure of syllable may be changed, phonemes may be reduced and syllable boundaries as well as lexical tones may be merged. This fact has long been noticed, but no quantified empirical data were actually presented in the literature until now. This paper focuses on a special type of syllable reduction in spontaneous Mandarin caused by heavy coarticulation of phonemes across syllable boundaries, namely the phenomenon of syllable contraction. Contracted syllables result from segmental deletions and omission of syllable boundary. This paper reports a series of corpus-based results of analyses on contracted syllables in Mandarin conversation by taking account of phonological as well as non-phonological factors.\n",

The influences of aspiration, voicing and gemination on the durations of closure and post-release segments of plosives as well as the duration of the preceding vowel were studied. It was observed that the post-release duration of a plosive changes systematically with manner of articulation. However, due to its large variation in continuous speech, the post-release duration alone is not sufficient to identify the manner of articulation of Hindi stops as hypothesised in earlier studies. A low value of the ratio of the duration of a vowel to the closure duration of the following plosive is a reliable indicator of gemination in Hindi stop consonants in continuous speech.\n",

Compared the lexical increase ratios based on the CVCV words, Japanese and Finnish showed regular patterns according to the word structures respectively. The Japanese patterns were very isochronical in any word structures, whereas the Finnish durational ratios stably decreased within the same moraic word structures with the same number of segments but different combinations of the same vowel and consonant. These results suggest that Japanese has a tendency to be more mora-counting than Finnish in temporal isochronity.\n",

    "This paper describes the analysis results on the control factors of Thai syllable duration, and a statistical control model using linear regression technique. The analyses have been carried out both at a syllable level and at a phrase level. In a syllable level duration control, the effects of five Thai tones and syllable structures are investigated. To analyze syllable structure effects statistically, we applied the quantification theory with two linguistic factors: (1) phone categories by themselves, and (2) the categories grouped by articulatory similarities. In a phrase level, the effects of position in a phrase and syllable counts in a phrase were analyzed. The experimental results showed that tones, syllable structures, and position in a phrase play significant roles on syllable duration control. Syllable counts in a phrase slightly affects the syllable duration. These analysis results have been integrated into a statistical control model. The duration assignment precision of the proposed model is evaluated using 2480-word speech data. Total correlation 0.73 between predicted values and observed values for test set samples shows the fair precision of the proposed control model.\n",

Unlike previous inquiries, the present study employs an on-line method using the Reaction Time measurement, in addition to the measurement of response frequencies. Regarding the peak height continuum, the mean RTs are shortest for within-category identification but longest for across-category identification. As for the peak alignment contrast, no identification boundary emerges and the mean RTs only reflect a difference between peaks aligned with the vowel onset and peaks aligned elsewhere. We conclude that the peak height contrast is discrete but the previously claimed discreteness of the peak alignment contrast is not borne out.\n",

    "Empirical study of the syntax-prosody relation is hampered by the fact that current prosodic models are essentially linear, while syntactic structure is hierarchical. The present contribution describes a syntax-prosody comparison heuristic based on two new algorithms: Time Tree Induction, TTI, for building a prosodic treebank from time-annotated speech data, and Tree Similarity Indexing, TSI) for comparing syntactic trees with the prosodic trees. Two parametrisations of the TTI algorithm, for different tree branching conditions, are applied to sentences taken from a read-aloud narrative, and compared with parses of the same sentences, using the TSI. In addition, null-hypotheses in the form of flat bracketing of the sentences are compared. A preference for iambic (heavy rightmost branch) grouping is found. The resulting quantitative evidence for syntax-prosody relations has applications in speech genre characterisation and in duration models for speech synthesis.\n",

Our system detects onsets and offsets in 8 frequency bands by a two-layer integrate-and-fire neural network. The continuous speech is segmented based on the timing of onsets and offsets. And the energy is used as another cue to locate the segmentation point. In order to improve the accuracy of segmenting, we introduce three time constraints by defining three refractory periods of neurons, which make syllable length no less than the minimum. Although the boundaries between syllables in high-speed speech are not salient, our system can still segment individual syllables from speech robustly and accurately.\n",

    "Speech is considered an efficient communication channel. This implies that the organization of utterances is such that more speaking effort is directed towards important parts than towards redundant parts. Based on a model of incremental word recognition, the importance of a segment is defined as its contribution to word-disambiguation. This importance is measured as the segmental information content, in bits. On a labeled Dutch speech corpus it is then shown that crucial aspects of the information structure of utterances partition the segmental information content and explain 90% of the variance. Two measures of acoustical reduction, duration and spectral center of gravity, are correlated with the segmental information content in such a way that more important phonemes are less reduced. It is concluded that the organization of conventional information structure does indeed increase efficiency.\n",

The algorithm plays an essential role in a model for adaptive learning of probabilistic ordering. The novelty in the proposed model is the combination of well-established methods from two different disciplines: graph theory and statistics. The set-up of this paper is mainly theoretical, and we follow a quite formal approach.

The present study seeks to investigate if pause duration is correlated with the length of sentences or phrases preceding and following a pause. We find that two independent factors - the length of an IP (intonational phrase) preceding a pause and the length of an IP following a pause combine superadditively. The probability of a pause being short (<300 ms) rises greatly if both the preceding and the following phrases are short(<=10 syllables).\n",

With the universal constraint of phoneme definitions, the point is statistically estimated by an iterative procedure to maximize the local likelihood using a large amount of speech data. We also mention a context dependent modeling of the proposed approach and its integration strategy to obtain more stability. The experimental results show favorable convergencies of both the fictitious points and their likelihoods, which give usefulness for the stable phoneme modeling.\n",

    "Semantic theories on focus and information structure assume that there are different accent types for thematic (backward-looking, known) and rhematic (forward-looking, new) information in languages as English and German. According to Steedman [1], thematic material may only be intonationally marked (= bear a pitch accent), if it \"contrasts with a different established or accommodatable\" theme [p. 656]. We shall show that intonational marking of themes in German seems rather gradual. Themes in contrastive contexts have a significantly longer stressed vowel, a higher and longer rise which results in a higher and more delayed peak than non-contrastive themes. Moreover, speakers can use different strategies to signal the contrast. Data were elicited by reading short paragraphs with a contrastive and non-contrastive pre-context. The use of many filler texts distracted subjects' attention from the contrast so that the data may be regarded as highly natural. Implementing these prosodic features in speech synthesis systems might help to avoid unnatural exaggerated prosodic realisations.\n",

    "This study examines the pattern of accentual lengthening (AL) over four-syllable mono-morphemic words in Standard Chinese (SC). I show that 1) the domain of AL in SC is best characterized as the constituent that is under focus; 2) the distribution of AL over a focused domain is non-uniform and there is a strong tendency of edge effect with the last syllable lengthened the most; and 3) different prosodic boundaries do not block but attenuate the spread of AL with different magnitudes. These results are also compared to the results of studies on AL in languages such as English and Dutch. While there are similarities of AL in these two typologically different languages, which open the possibility that some effects of AL are universal, there are clearly important differences in the way that AL is distributed over the focused constituent in different languages, due to the specific phonology of the language.\n",

    "Choice of the phonetic units for speech recognizer is a factor greatly affecting the system performance. Phonetic units are normally defined according to the acoustic properties in parts of speech. Nevertheless, with the limit of training data, too delicate acoustic properties are ignored. Syllable structure is one of the properties usually ignored in English phonetic units due to the structure complexity. Some language like Chinese successfully gets the benefit from incorporating this property in the phonetic units, as the language itself is naturally syllabic and has only small amount of subsegments (onsets, nuclei, and codas). Thai, as some point between English and Chinese, has more subsegments than Chinese but not as much as English. There are two main steps in this paper. First, prove that Thai phonetic units can be defined as a set of subsegments without any data sparseness problem. Second, demonstrate that subsegmental phonetic units give better accuracy rate from integrating the syllable structure information and reduce a lot of number of triphone units because of left and right context constraints in the syllable structure.\n",

Three experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1 it was tested whether they could search embedded words by deleting word initial consonants. In Experiments 2 and 3 it was tested whether they could construct new words by manipulating consonants and vowels at word initial and medial positions. The results show that they could successfully manage these tasks with high accuracy.

    "This paper investigates acoustic, phonetic, and phonological representations of spoken vowels. For this purpose four experiments have been conducted. First, by drawing the analogy between the spectral energy distribution of vowels and the vowel space concept of Dependency Phonology, we achieve a new phonologically motivated vowel quality representation of spoken vowels which we name the / i/-/ a/-/ u/- ness. As a second step, it is shown that the extension of this approach is connected with the work of Pols, van der Kamp & Plomp 1969 [1] who, among other things, predicted formant frequencies from the spectral energy distribution of vowels. Third, the vowel quality relating to the IPA vowel diagram is derived directly from the spectral energy distribution. Finally, we compare this method with a formant and fundamental frequency based approach introduced by Pfitzinger 2003 [2]. While both the /i/-/a/-/u/-ness of vowels as well as the perceived vowel quality prediction are quite robust and therefore useful for both signal pre-processing and vowel quality research, the formant prediction achieved the lowest accuracy for the mapping to the IPA vowel diagram.\n",

If it were possible to adapt the F0 contour of one speaker to sound like that of another speaker, using a small, easily obtainable parameter set, this would be extremely valuable. We present a new method for the transformation of F0 contours from one speaker to another based on a small linguistically motivated parameter set. The system performs a piecewise linear mapping using these parameters. A perceptual experiment clearly demonstrates that the presented system is at least as good as an existing technique for all speaker pairs, and that in many cases it is much better and almost as good as using the target F0 contour.\n",

It takes the mean and shape of syllable pitch contour as two basic modeling units and considers several affecting factors that contribute to their variations. Parameters of the two models are automatically estimated by the EM algorithm. Experimental results showed that RMSEs of 0.551 ms and 0.614 ms in the reconstructed pitch were obtained for the closed and open tests, respectively. All inferred values of those affecting factors agreed well with our prior linguistic knowledge. Besides, the prosodic states automatically labeled by the pitch mean model provided useful cues to determine the prosodic phrase boundaries occurred at inter-syllable locations without punctuation marks. So it is a promising pitch modeling approach.\n",

    "For the present paper, a Bayesian probabilistic framework for the task of automatic acquisition of intonational phrase breaks was established. By considering two different conditional independence assumptions, the naive Bayes and Bayesian networks approaches were regarded and evaluated against the CART algorithm, which has been previously used with success. A finite length window of minimal morphological and syntactic resources was incorporated, i.e. the POS label and the kind of phrase boundary, a novel syntactic feature that has not been applied to intonational phrase break detection before. This feature can be used in languages where syntactic parsers are not available and proves to be important, not only for the proposed Bayesian methodologies but for other algorithms, like CART. Trained on a 5500 word database, Bayesian networks proved to be the most effective in terms of precision (82,3%) and recall (77,2%) for predicting phrase breaks.\n",

    "Perception of vocal styles is of paramount importance in vocal server application as the global style of a telecom service is highly dependant on the voice used. In this work we develop tools for automatic inference of perceived vocal styles for a set of 100 vocal sequences. In a first stage, twenty subjective evaluation criteria have been identified by running perceptive experiments with naive listeners. In a second stage, the vocal sequences have been parameterised using more than a hundred acoustic features representing prosody, spectral energy distribution, articulation and waveform. Then, regression analysis and neural networks are used for predicting the subjective score of each voice for each subjective criterion. The results show that the prediction error is generally low: it seems possible to predict automatically the perceived quality of the sequences. Moreover, the prediction error decreases when non-significant parameters are removed.\n",

    "Although word stress is usually seen as a powerful speech-segmentation cue, the results of several cross-modal fragment priming experiments reveal strong limitations to stress-based segmentation. When stress was pitted against phonotactic and coarticulatory cues, substantial effects of the latter two cues were found, but there was no evidence for stress-based segmentation. However, when the stimuli were presented in a background of noise, the pattern of results reversed: Strong syllables generated more priming than weak ones, regardless of coarticulation and phonotactics. Furthermore, a similar dependency was found between stress and lexicality. Priming was stronger when the prime was preceded by a real than a nonsense word, regardless of the stress pattern of the prime. Yet, again, a reversal in cue dominance was observed when the stimuli were played in noise. These results underscore the secondary role of stress-based segmentation in clear speech, and its efficiency in impoverished listening conditions. More generally, they call for an integrated, hierarchical, and signal-contingent approach to speech segmentation.\n",

    "For emotion recognition, we selected pitch, log energy, formant, mel-band energies, and mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as the base features, and added velocity/ acceleration of pitch and MFCCs to form feature streams. We extracted statistics used for discriminative classifiers, assuming that each stream is a one-dimensional signal. Extracted features were analyzed by using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results showed that pitch and energy were the most important factors. Using two different kinds of databases, we compared emotion recognition performance of various classifiers: SVM, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), QDA and hidden Markov model (HMM). With the text-independent SUSAS database, we achieved the best accuracy of 96.3% for stressed/neutral style classification and 70.1% for 4-class speaking style classification using Gaussian SVM, which is superior to the previous results. With the speaker-independent AIBO database, we achieved 42.3% accuracy for 5-class emotion recognition.\n",

    "This paper presents work in progress on the automatic detection of prosodic prominence in continuous speech. Prosodic prominence involves two different phonetic features: pitch accents, connected with fundamental frequency (F0) movements and syllable overall energy, and stress, which exhibits a strong correlation with syllable nuclei duration and mid-to-high-frequency emphasis. By measuring these acoustic parameters it is possible to build an automatic system capable of correctly identifying prominent syllables with an agreement, with human-tagged data, comparable with the inter-human agreement reported in the literature. This system does not require any training phase, additional information or annotation, it is not tailored to a specific set of data and can be easily adapted to different languages.\n",

    "This paper presents and discusses the speaker dependent emotion recognition with large set of statistical features. The speaker dependent emotion recognition gains in present the best accuracy performance. Recognition was performed on English, Slovenian, Spanish, and French InterFace emotional speech databases. All databases include 9 speakers. The InterFace databases include neutral speaking style and six emotions: disgust, surprise, joy, fear, anger and sadness. Speech features for emotion recognition were determined in two steps. In the first step, acoustical features were defined and in the second statistical features were calculated from acoustical features. Acoustical features are composed from pitch, derivative of pitch, energy, derivative of energy, duration of speech segments, jitter, and shimmer. Statistical features are statistical presentations of acoustical features. In previous study feature vector was composed from 26 elements. In this study the feature vector was composed from 144 elements. The new feature set was called large set of statistical features. Emotion recognition was performed using artificial neural networks. Significant improvement was achieved for all speakers except for Slovenian male and second English male speaker were the improvement was about 2%. Large set of statistical features improve the accuracy of recognised emotion in average for about 18%.\n",

Two intonation feature contours, extracted from F0 contour, were proposed. The feature contours were converted to feature vector to use as input of neural network recognizer. The recognition results show that an average recognition rate is 63.4% for male speakers and 75.4% for female speakers.

    "A method was developed to utilize linguistic information (lexical accent types and syntactic boundaries) to improve the performance of the automatic extraction of the F_0 contour generation process model commands. The extraction scheme is first to smooth the observed F_0 contour by a piecewise 3rd order polynomial function and to locate accent command positions by taking the derivative of the function. If the results of automatic extraction differ from those estimated from the linguistic information, they are modified according to the several rules. The results showed that some errors could be corrected by the use of linguistic information, especially when the initial word of an accent phrase is type 0 (flat) accent. As a whole, the correct extraction rate (recall rate) was increased from 79.8% to 82.3% for phrase commands and from 81.6% to 85.9% for accent commands.\n",

    "The long-term purpose of this study is to determine whether there are \"visual\" cues to prosody. An audiovisual corpus was recorded from a male native French speaker. The sentences had a subject-verb-object (SVO) syntactic structure. Four conditions were studied: focus on each phrase (S,V,O) and no focus. Normal and reiterant modes were recorded. We first measured F0, duration and intensity to validate the corpus. The pitch maximum over the utterance was generally on a focused syllable and duration and intensity were higher for the focused syllables. Then lip aperture and jaw opening were extracted from the video. The jaw opening maximum generally fell on one of the focused syllables, but peak velocity was more consistently correlated with focus. Moreover, lip closure duration was longer for the first segment of the focused phrase. We can therefore assume that there are visual aspects in prosody that may be used in communication.\n",

    "In this study, we introduced a new model of how a human understands speech in real time and performed a cognitive experiment to investigate the unit for processing and understanding speech. In the model, first humans segment the acoustical signal into some acoustical units, and then the mental lexicon is accessed and searched for the segmented units. For this segmentation, we believe that prosody information must be used. In order to investigate how humans segment acoustical speech using only prosody, we performed an experiment in which participants listened to a pair of segmented speech materials, where each material was divided from the same speech material where the two segmentation positions differed from each other, and judged which material sounded more natural. On the basis of the results of this experiment, it is suggested that humans tend to segment speech based on the accent rules of Japanese, and that the introduced model is supported.\n",

    "We illustrate the development of a universal phone recognizer for conversational telephone-quality speech. The acoustic models for this system were trained in a novel fashion and with a wide variety of language data, thus permitting it to recognize most of the world's major phonemic categories. Moreover, with push-button ease, this recognizer can automatically reconfigure itself to apply the strongest language model in its inventory to whatever language it is used on. In this paper, we not only describe this system, but we also provide performance measurements for it using extensive testing material both from languages in its training set as well as from a language it has never seen. Surprisingly, the recognizer produces near-equivalent performance between the two types of data thus showing its true universality. This recognizer presents a viable solution for processing conversational, telephone-quality speech in any language - even in low-density languages.\n",

    "The need and importance of automatically recognizing emotions from human speech has grown with the increasing role of human-computer interaction applications. This paper explores the detection of domain-specific emotions using a fuzzy inference system to detect two emotion categories, negative and nonnegative emotions. The input features are a combination of segmental and suprasegmental acoustic information; feature sets are selected from a 21-dimensional feature set and applied to the fuzzy classifier. Our fuzzy inference system is designed through a data-driven approach. The design of the fuzzy inference system has two phases: one for initialization for which fuzzy c-means method is used, and the other is fine-tuning of parameters of the fuzzy model. For fine-tuning, a well known neuro-fuzzy method are used. Results from on spoken dialog data from a call center application show that the optimized FIS with two rules (FIS-2) improves emotion classification by 63.0% for male data and 73.7% for female over previous results obtained using linear discriminant classifier.\n",

    "This paper examines whether a human is aware of slight prosodic differences in a computer voice and changes his/her behaviors accordingly through interaction, when the prosodic difference carries informational significance. We conduct a route selection experiment, in which subjects were asked to find a route in a computer generated 3-D maze. The maze system occasionally provides a confirmation in response to the subject's choice of a route. The prosodic characteristics of confirmation utterances are made to marginally change according to whether the route selected is the right route for reaching the goal or a wrong route that ends up in a cul de sac. In this experiment, subjects are able to pick up the difference and successfully navigate through the maze. This result demonstrates that subjects are sensitive to even a slight change in the voice's prosodic characteristics and that computer voice prosody can affect the route selection behaviors of subjects.\n",

Speech intensity modeling is often considered as algorithmically and perceptually less important. Departing from a syllable-based, trainable prosody model the authors tested new factors of influence to improve the predicted intensity contour on phonemic level. Therefore, a German newsreader corpus has been analyzed with respect to typical intensity patterns. The f0-intensity interaction has the most significant influence and was perceptually evaluated by 32 listeners ranking 20 different stimuli.

Strong positive/negative correlation is observed between the markedness of adverbs and F_0 height when an adjective phrase with a positive/negative image is followed to the current adverb phrase. These consistencies have been perceptually confirmed by naturalness evaluation tests using the same two-phrase samples with different F_0 heights.

    "The current paper presents a preliminary study on the production and perception of syllabic tones of Vietnamese. A speech corpus consisting of fifty-two six-syllable sequences with various combinations of tones was uttered by two speakers of Standard Vietnamese, one male and one female. The corpus was labeled on the syllabic level and analyzed using the Fujisaki model. Results show that the six tone types basically fall into two categories: Level, rising, curve and falling tone can be accurately modeled by using tone commands of positive or negative polarity. The so-called drop and broken tones, however, obviously require a special control causing creaky voice and in cases a very fast drop in F0 leading to temporary F0 halving or even quartering. In contrast to the drop tone, the broken tone exhibits an F0 rise and hence a positive tone command right after the creak occurs. Further observations suggest that drop and broken tone do not only differ from the other four tones with respect to their F0 characteristics, but also as to their much tenser articulation. A perception experiment performed with natural and resynthesized stimuli shows, inter alia, that tone 4 is most prone to confusion and that tone 6 obviously requires tense articulation as well as vocal fry to be identified reliably.\n",

    "The affects are expressed in different levels of speech: meta-linguistic (expressiveness), linguistic (attitudes), both anchored in the \"linguistic time\", and para-linguistic (emotions expressions) that is anchored in the emotional causes timing. In an experimental approach, the corpus are the base of analysis. Main of emotional corpus have been produced by acting/elicitating speakers on one side (with a possible strong control), and on the other side they have been collected in \"reallife\". This paper proposes both to generate a Wizard of Oz method and some tools (E-Wiz and Top Logic, Sound Teacher applications) in order to control the production of authentic data, separately for the three levels of affects.\n",

    "Through efforts over the past fifteen years, we have acquired a great deal of experience in designing spoken dialogue systems that provide access to large corpora of data in a variety of different knowledge domains, such as flights, hotels, restaurants, weather, etc. In our recent research, we have begun to shift our focus towards developing tools that enable the rapid development of new applications. This paper addresses a novel approach that drives system design from the on-line knowledge resource. We were motivated by a desire to minimize the need for a pre-determined dialogue flow. In our approach, decisions on dialogue flow are made dynamically based on analyses of data, either prior to user interaction or during the dialogue itself. Automated methods, used to organize numeric and symbolic data, can be applied at every turn, as user constraints are being specified. This helps the user mine through large data sets to a few choices by allowing the system to synthesize intelligent summaries of the data, created on-the-fly at every turn. Moreover automatic methods are ultimately more robust against the frequent changes to on-line content. Simulations generating hundreds of dialogues have produced log files that allow us to assess and improve system behavior, including system responses and interactions with the dialogue flow. Together, these techniques are aimed towards the goal of instantiating new domains with little or no input from a human developer.\n",

Among the functionality provided by the CR server is the inheritance and masking of historical information, pragmatic verification, as well as reference and ellipsis resolution. The new server additionally features a process that attempts to reconstruct the intention of the user given a robust parse of an utterance. Design issues are described, followed by a description of each function in the context resolution process along with examples. The effectiveness of the CR server in various domains attests to its success as a module for context resolution.\n",

We have modified the DAMSL dialogic schema to create a dialogue act taxonomy appropriate for customer services. To capture the semantics, we use a domain-independent framework populated with domain-specific lists. We have designed a new flexible, platform-independent annotation tool, XDML Tool, and annotated several hundred dialogues in French and English. Inter-annotator agreement was moderate. We are using these data to design our dialogue system, and we hope that they will help us to derive appropriate dialogue strategies for novel situations.\n",

Speakers were also subject to time-pressure, thereby increasing the cognitive burden of the overall task at hand. The duress of the speaker, as determined by disfluency rate, was examined across four conditions of variable feedback and timing.

The initiator of a discourse segment has control; the non-initiator can contribute to the purpose of the segment, but this does not result in that person taking over control.

Automatic speech recognition for German is more problematic than for a language such as English in that the inflectional morphology of German and its highly generative process of compounding lead to many more out of vocabulary words for a given vocabulary size. Experiments undertaken to tackle this problem and reduce the transcription error rate include bringing the language models up to date, improved pronunciation models, semi-automatically constructed pronunciation lexicons and increasing the size of the system's vocabulary.\n",

    "The pronunciation model providing the mapping from the written form of words to their pronunciations is called the text-to-phoneme (TTP) mapping. Such a mapping is commonly used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) as well as in text-to-speech (TTS) applications. Rule based TTP mappings can be derived for structured languages, such as Finnish and Japanese. Data-driven TTP mappings are usually applied for non-structured languages such as English and Danish. Artificial neural network (ANN) and decision tree (DT) approaches are commonly applied in this task. Compared to the ANN methods, the DT methods usually provide more accurate pronunciation models. The DT methods can, however, lead to a set of models with a high memory footprint if the mappings between letters and phonemes are complex. In this paper, we present a weighted entropy training method for the DT based TTP mapping. Statistical information about the vocabulary is utilized in the training process in order to optimize the TTP performance for pre-defined memory requirements. The results obtained in the simulation experiments indicate that the memory requirements of the TTP models can be significantly reduced without degrading the mapping accuracy. The applicability of the approach is also verified in the speech recognition experiments.\n",

    "Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problems are frequently seen when adapting a language model to another task where there are some observed word classes but few individual words, such as names, places and other proper nouns. Simple task adaptation cannot handle this problem properly. In this paper, for task dependent OOV words in the noun category, we adopt a hierarchical language model. In this modeling, the lower class model expressing word phonotactics does not require any additional task dependent corpora for training. It can be trained independent of the upper class model of conventional word class N-grams, as the proposed hierarchical model clearly separates Inter-word characteristics and Intra-word characteristics. This independent-layered training capability makes it possible to apply this model to general vocabularies and tasks in combination with conventional language model adaptation techniques. Speech recognition experiments showed a 19-point increase in word accuracy (from 54% to 73%) in the with-OOV sentences, and comparable accuracy (85%) in the without-OOV sentences, compared with a conventional adapted model. This improvement corresponds to the performance when all OOVs are ideally registered in a dictionary.\n",

    "This paper focuses on some characteristics of disfluencies in human-human (HHI) and human-computer (HCI) interaction corpora to outline similarities and differences. The main variables studied are disfluency rates and prosodic features. Structured, table-like input increases the disfluency rate in HCI and decreases it in HHI. Direct exposure (visibility) to the interface also increases the rate and gives speech a unique prosodic pattern of hyperarticulation. In most of the studied corpora, silences at the disfluency site are not predicted by syntactic rules. Similarities between HCI and HHI exist mainly in the prosodic realizations of the reparandum and the repair. The findings contribute to better understanding and modeling of disfluencies. Speech-based interfaces need to focus on communication types that are well-understood and prone to good modeling.\n",

Posterior probabilities for articulatory-acoustic features are obtained from artificial neural nets and are used to classify speech within the scope of syllables instead of phones.

    "In this paper, we show how a multi-level class hierarchy can be used to better estimate the likelihood of an unseen event. In classical backoff n-gram models, the (n-1)-gram model is used to estimate the probability of an unseen n-gram. In the approach we propose, we use a class hierarchy to define an appropriate context which is more general than the unseen n-gram but more specific than the (n-1)-gram. Each node in the hierarchy is a class containing all the words of the descendant nodes (classes). Hence, the closer a node is to the root, the more general the corresponding class is. We also investigate in this paper the impact of the hierarchy depth and the Turing's discount coefficient on the performance of the model. We evaluate the backoff hierarchical n-gram models on WSJ database with two large vocabularies, 5, 000 and 20, 000 words. Experiments show up to 26% improvement on the unseen events perplexity and up to 12% improvement in the WER when a backoff hierarchical class trigram language model is used on an ASR test set with a relatively large number of unseen events.\n",

    "This paper describes a semantic annotation scheme for spoken dialog corpora. Manual semantic annotation of large corpora is tedious, expensive, and subject to inconsistencies. Consistency is a necessity to increase the usefulness of corpus for developing and evaluating spoken understanding models and for linguistics studies. A semantic representation, which is based on a concept dictionary definition, has been formalized and is described. Each utterance is divided into semantic segments and each segment is assigned with a 5-tuplets containing a mode, the underlying concept, the normalized form of the concept, the list of related segments, and an optional comment about the annotation. Based on this scheme, a tool was developed which ensures that the provided annotations respect the semantic representation. The tool includes interfaces for both the formal definition of the hierarchical concept dictionary and the annotation process. An experiment was conducted to assess inter-annotator agreement using both a human-human dialog corpus and a human-machine dialog corpus. For human-human dialogs, the agreement rate, computed on the triplets (mode, concept, value) is 61%, and the agreement rate on the concepts alone is 74%. For the human-machine dialogs, the percentage of agreement on the triplet is 83% and the correct concept identification rate is 93%.\n",

    "In this paper a corpus-based decompounding algorithm is described and applied for German LVCSR. The decompounding algorithm contributes to address two major problems for LVCSR: lexical coverage and letter-to-sound conversion. The idea of the algorithm is simple: given a word start of length k only few different characters can continue an admissible word in the language. But concerning compounds, if word start k reaches a constituent word boundary, the set of successor characters can theoretically include any character. The algorithm has been applied to a 300M word corpus with 2.6M distinct words. 800k decomposition rules have been extracted automatically. OOV (out of vocabulary) word reductions of 25% to 50% relative have been achieved using word lists from 65k to 600k words. Pronunciation dictionaries have been developed for the LIMSI 300k German recognition system. As no language specific knowledge is required beyond the text corpus, the algorithm can apply more generally to any compounding language.\n",

    "In this paper, we describe a cross-morpheme pronunciation variation model which is especially useful for constructing morpheme-based pronunciation lexicon for Korean LVCSR. There are a lot of pronunciation variations occurring at morpheme boundaries in continuous speech. Since phonemic context together with morphological category and morpheme boundary information affect Korean pronunciation variations, we have distinguished pronunciation variation rules according to the locations such as within a morpheme, across a morpheme boundary in a compound noun, across a morpheme boundary in an eojeol, and across an eojeol boundary. In 33K-morpheme Korean CSR experiment, an absolute improvement of 1.16% in WER from the baseline performance of 23.17% WER is achieved by modeling cross-morpheme pronunciation variations with a context-dependent multiple pronunciation lexicon.\n",

    "In this paper, we describe a perceptual voice recognition method to improve the naturalness of synthesized speech for Mandarin Chinese text-to-speech (TTS) baseline system. As a large TTS speech corpus, speech data always has different acoustic properties for different data recording conditions. Speech data recorded under different conditions can finally influence the naturalness of synthesized speech. Concerning this fact, we separate the speech data in a TTS corpus into several different voice classes based on an iterative voice recognition method, which is something like speaker recognition. Among each class, speech units will be considered to have the same voice characteristics. Based on the voice recognition result, a novel unit selection algorithm is performed to select better units to synthesize a more natural-sounding speech. Primary experiment shows the possibility and validity of the method.\n",

    "In concatenative text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis systems unit selection aims to reduce the number of concatenation points in the synthesized speech and make concatenation joins as smooth as possible. This research considers synthesis of completely new utterances from non-uniform units, whereby the most appropriate units, according to acoustic and phonetic criteria, are selected from a myriad of similar speech database candidates. A Viterbi-style algorithm dynamically selects the most suitable database units from a large speech database by considering concatenation and target costs. Concatenation costs are derived from mel filter bank amplitudes, whereas target costs are considered in terms of the phonemic and phonetic properties of required units. Within subjects and between subjects ANOVA [9] evaluation of listeners' scores showed that the TTS system with this method of unit selection was preferred in 52% of test sentences.\n",

The units are selected by minimizing the combination of target and join costs for a given sentence. In this paper, we propose a new approach to train the weight parameters associated with the cost functions used for unit selection in concatenative speech synthesis. We first view the unit selection as a classification problem, and apply the discriminative training technique which is found an efficient way to parameter estimation in speech recognition. Instead of defining an objective function which accounts for the subjective speech quality, we take the classification error as the objective function to be optimized. The classification error is approximated by a smooth function and the relevant parameters are updated by means of the gradient descent technique.\n",

    "Speech unit selection algorithms have the task to find a single sequence of speech units that optimally fit the target transcription of an utterance that must be synthesized. In doing so, these algorithms ignore a very large number of possible alternative unit sequences that lead to alternative renderings of that utterance. In this paper we set out to explore these alternative unit sequences - by introducing interactive unit selection.\n",
    "Interactive unit selection is based on feedback of a listener. To collect this feedback we implement two levels of control: an elaborate GUI, and a simple XML tag mechanism. The GUI offers access to unit selection with a granularity of a single speech unit, and allows a user to set prosodic constraints for the selection of alternative speech units. The XML tag mechanism operates on words, and allows the user to request an nth-best alternative selection.\n",
    "Results show that interactive unit selection succeeds in correcting most of the synthesis problems that occur in our default synthesis system, providing very detailed information that can be used to improve our run-time algorithms. This work not only provides a powerful research tool, it also leads to a number of commercial applications. The GUI can be used efficiently to improve speech synthesis off-line - to the extent that it eliminates the need to make special recordings for domain specific applications. The XML tag, on the other hand, can be used to quickly optimize the output of the system.\n",

We use the norm of a local cost for each segment as an integrated cost function for a segment sequence to consider both the degradation of naturalness over the entire synthetic speech and the local degradation. The cost function is optimized by adjusting not only the power coefficient of the norm but also weights for sub-costs so that the integrated cost corresponds better to perceptual scores determined by perceptual experiments. As a result, it is clarified that the correspondence of the cost can be improved to a greater degree by optimizing both the weights and the power coefficient than by optimizing either the weights or the power coefficient. However, it is also clarified that the correspondence is insufficient after optimizing the integrated cost function.\n",

Statistical approach to speech segmentation using hidden Markov models (HMMs) is applied in the baseline system. Several improvements of this system are then proposed to get more accurate segmentation results. These enhancements mainly concern the various strategies of HMM initialization (flat-start initialization, hand-labeled or speaker independent HMM bootstrapping). Since HTK, the hidden Markov model toolkit, was utilized in our work, a correction of the output boundary placements is proposed to reflect speech parameterization mechanism. An objective comparison of various automatic methods and manual segmentation is performed to find out the best method. The best results were obtained for boundary-specific statistical correction of the segmentation that resulted from bootstrapping with hand-labeled HMMs (96% segmentation accuracy in tolerance region 20 ms).\n",

The assumption is that with a better selection mechanism we can reduce the amount of pitch modification required, thereby reducing speech degradation. In addition, we present a perceptual experiment that investigates the degradation introduced by pitch modification using the OGIresLPC algorithm. We correlated the weighted perceptual score with different pitch and delta pitch distances. The best combination of distance measures is able to explain 63% of the variance in the perceptual scores. Decreasing the pitch is shown to have a higher impact on perception than increasing the pitch.\n",

    "Data sparsity is a major problem for data driven prosodic models. Being able to share prosodic data across speakers is a potential solution to this problem. This paper explores this potential solution by addressing two questions: 1) Does a larger less sparse model from a different speaker produce more natural speech than a small sparse model built from the original speaker? 2)Does a different speaker's larger model generate more unit selection errors than a small sparse model built from the original speaker? A unit selection approach is used to produce a lazy learning model of three English RP speaker's f0 and durational parameters. Speaker 1 (the target speaker) had a much smaller database (approximately one quarter to one fifth the size) of the other two. Speaker 2 was a female speaker with frequent mid phrase rises. Speaker 3 was a male speaker with a similar f0 range to speaker 1 and with a measured prosodic style suitable for news and financial text.\n",
    "We apply the models created for speaker 2 (an inappropriate model) and speaker 3 (an appropriate model) to speaker 1 and compare the results. Three passages (of three to four sentences in length) from challenging prosodic genres (news report, poetry and personal email) were synthesised using the target speaker and each of the three models. The synthesised utterances were played to 15 native english subjects and rated using a 5 point MOS scale. In addition, 7 experienced speech engineers rated each word for errors on a three point scale: 1. Acceptable, 2. Poor, 3. Unacceptable.\n",
    "The results suggest that a large model from an appropriate speaker does not sound more natural or produce fewer errors than a smaller model generated from the individual speaker's own data. In addition it shows that an inappropriate model does produce both less natural and more errors in the speech. High variance in both subject and materials analysis suggest both tests are far from ideal and that evaluation techniques for both error rate and naturalness need to improve.\n",

    "One of the crucial problems in developing high quality Thai text-to-speech synthesis is to detect phrase break from Thai texts. Unlike English, Thai has no word boundary delimiter and no punctuation mark at the end of a sentence. It makes the problem more serious. Because when we detect phrase break incorrectly, it is not only producing unnatural speech but also creating the wrong meaning. In this paper, we apply machine learning algorithms namely C4.5 and RIPPER in detecting phrase break. These algorithms can learn useful features for locating a phrase break position. The features which are investigated in our experiments are collocations in different window sizes and the number of syllables before and after a word in question to a phrase break position. We compare the results from C4.5 and RIPPER with a based-line method (Part-of-Speech sequence model). The experiment shows that C4.5 and RIPPER appear to outperform the based-line method and RIPPER performs better accuracy results than C4.5.\n",

The model represents a speech unit as a synthesis of several types of features, each of which has been computed using non-linear, asynchronous interpolation of neighboring basis vectors associated with known phonemic identities.

    "We have been developing corpus-based synthesis of fundamental frequency (F_0) contours for Japanese. Since, in our method, the synthesis is done under the constraint of F_0 contour generation process model, a rather good quality is still kept even if the prediction process is done poorly. Although it was already shown that the synthesized F_0 contours sounded as highly natural as those using heuristic rules carefully arranged by experts, the F_0 model parameters for the training corpus were extracted with some manual processes. In the current paper, the automatically extracted parameters are used, and a good result is obtained. Also several features are added as the inputs to the statistical method to obtain better results. Some results on the accent phrase boundary prediction in the similar corpus-based framework are also shown.\n",

    "This paper describes the hybrid unit selection strategy for restricted domain synthesis in the SmartKom dialog system. Restricted domains are characterized as being biased toward domain specific utterances while being unlimited in terms of vocabulary size. This entails that unit selection in restricted domains must deal with both domain specific and open-domain material. The strategy presented here combines the advantages of two existing unit selection approaches, motivated by the claim that the phonological structure matching approach is advantageous for domain specific parts of utterances, while the acoustic clustering algorithm is more appropriate for open-domain material. This dichotomy is also reflected in the speech database, which consists of a domain specific and an open-domain part. The text material for the open-domain part was constructed to optimize coverage of diphones and phonemes in different contexts.\n",

    "This work comes within the scope of concatenative speech synthesis. We propose a method to evaluate the criteria used in units selection methods. Usually criteria are evaluated in a comparative black-box way : the performance of a criterion are measured relatively to other criteria performances, thus evaluation is not always discriminant or formative. We present a glas-box method to measure the performances of a criterion in an absolute way. The principle is to explore the possible sequences of units able to synthesize a given target utterance, to assign to each sequence a value X of objective quality and a value Y related to the tested criterion ; then mutual information I(X;Y) is calculated to measure the explicative power of the criterion Y in relation to the quality variable X. Results are encouraging concerning criteria associated to units types, but combinatorial problems weigh heavy for criteria related to units instances.\n",

    "Unit selection text-to-speech (TTS) conversion is an ongoing research for the speech synthesis community. This paper is focused on tuning the weights involved in the target and concatenation cost metrics. We propose a method for automatically adjusting these weights simultaneously by means of diphone and triphone pairs. This method is based on techniques provided by the evolutionary computation community, taking advantage of their robustness in noisy domains. The experiments and their analyses demonstrate its good performance in this problem, thus, overcoming some constraints assumed by previous works and leading to a new interesting framework for further investigations. La conversio text-parla (CTP) basada en seleccio d'unitats es una de les linies de recerca actuals de la comunitat cientifica de sintesi de veu. Aquest treball se centra en l'ajust dels pesos involucrats en el calcul dels costos d'unitat i de concatenacio. Es presenta un metode automatic per l'ajust simultani d'aquests pesos a partir de parelles de difonemes i trifonemes. Aquest metode esta basat en tecniques obtingudes de la comunitat de computacio evolutiva, aprofitant la robustesa d'aquests algorismes en dominis sorollosos. Els experiments que s'han dut a terme i la seva posterior analisi demostren el bon funcionament del metode en aquest problema, ja que supera algunes de les restriccions d'anteriors metodes.

Two consortia submitted proposals on speech recognition front ends for this evaluation: (1) Qualcomm, ICSI, and OGI (QIO), and (2) Motorola, France Telecom, and Alcatel (MFA). These front ends used a variety of noise reduction techniques including discriminative transforms, feature normalization, voice activity detection, and blind equalization. Participants used a common speech recognition engine to postprocess their features. In this paper, we show that the results of this evaluation were not significantly impacted by suboptimal recognition system parameter settings. Without any front end specific tuning, the MFA front end outperforms the QIO front end by 9.6% relative. With tuning, the relative performance gap increases to 15.8%. Both the mismatched microphone and additive noise evaluation conditions resulted in a significant degradation in performance for both front ends.\n",

The approach described in this paper is based on estimating the signal's cumulative density functions on the filter bank using a small number of quantiles. A two-step transformation is then applied to reduce the difference between these quantiles and the ones estimated on the training data. The first step is a power function transformation applied to each individual filter channel, followed by a linear combination of neighboring filters. On the Aurora 4 16kHz database the average word error rates could be reduced from 60.8% to 37.6% (clean training) and from 38.0% to 31.5% (multi condition training).\n",

A number of different model-based and signal-based noise robustness techniques have been tested. Results show that it is difficult to design a technique that is superior in every condition. Because of this we combined different techniques to improve results. Best results have been obtained when short time compensation / normalization methods are combined with long term environmental adaptation and robust acoustic models. The best average error rate obtained over the 52 conditions is 30.8%. This represents a 40% relative improvement compared to the baseline results [1].\n",

    "In this paper we focus on the challenging task of noise robustness for large vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) systems in non-stationary noise environments. We have extended our Model-Based Feature Enhancement (MBFE) algorithm - that we earlier successfully applied to small vocabulary CSR in the AURORA-2 framework - to cope with the new demands that are imposed by the large vocabulary size in the AURORA-4 task. To incorporate a priori knowledge of the background noise, we combine scalable Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of the cepstral feature vectors of both clean speech and noise, using a Vector Taylor Series approximation in the power spectral domain. Then, a global MMSE-estimate of the clean speech is calculated based on this combined HMM. This technique is easily embeddable in the feature extraction module of a recogniser and is intrinsically suited for the removal of non-stationary additive noise. Our approach is validated on the AURORA-4 task, revealing a significant gain in noise robustness over the baseline.\n",

The first approach is to collect sentences that bilingual travel experts consider useful for people going-to/coming-from another country. The resulting English-Japanese aligned corpora are collectively called the basic travel expression corpus (BTEC), which is now being translated into several other languages. The second approach tries to expand this corpus by generating many \"synonymous\" expressions for each sentence. Although we can create large corpora by the above two approaches relatively cheaply, they may be different from utterances in actual conversation. Thus, as the third approach, we are collecting dialogue corpora by letting two people talk, each in his/her native language, through a speech-to-speech translation system. To concentrate on translation modules, we have replaced speech recognition modules with human typists. We will report some of the characteristics of these corpora as well.\n",

    "NAGAUTA is a classical style of the Japanese singing. It has very original and unique prosodic patterns in its singing, where an abrupt and sharp change of F_0 is always observed at a transition from a note to another. This F_0 change is often found even where the transition is not accompanied by a change of tone. In this paper, we propose a model to synthesize this unique F_0 pattern from the standard notation. Further, this paper shows an interesting phenomenon about power movements at the F_0 changes. Acoustic analysis of NAGAUTA singing samples reveals that sharp increases of F_0 and sharp decreases of power are observed synchronously. Although no discussion on physical mechanisms of this phenomenon is done in this paper, another model to generate this unique power pattern is also proposed. Evaluation experiments are done through listening and their results indicate high validity of the two proposed models.\n",

    "Stress is known to be an important prosodic feature of speech. The recognition of stressed speech has always been an important issue for speech researchers. On the other hand, providing a large corpus with the coverage of all different stressed conditions in a certain language is a difficult task. Farsi (Persian) has been no exception to this. In this research, our aim has been to evaluate the effect of stress on prosodic features of Farsi language, such as phoneme duration, pitch frequency and the pitch contour slope. These might be valuable in further research in speech recognition. As the main influence of stress is on vowels, the effect of stress on such parameters as duration and pitch frequency and its slope on the phoneme level and for vowels has been evaluated.\n",

    "Does prosody help word recognition? In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework in which word and phoneme are dependent on prosody in a way that improves word recognition. The prosody attribute that we investigate in this study is the lengthening of speech segments in the vicinity of intonational phrase boundaries. Explicit Duration Hidden Markov Model (EDHMM) is implemented to provide an accurate phoneme duration model. This study is conducted on Boston University Radio News Corpus with prosodic boundaries marked using ToBI labelling system. We found that lengthening of the phrase final rhymes can be reliably modelled by EDHMM, which significantly improves the prosody dependent acoustic modelling. Conversely, no systematic duration variation is found at phrase initial position. With prosody dependence implemented in the acoustic model, pronunciation model and language model, both word recognition accuracy and boundary recognition accuracy are improved by 1% over systems without prosody dependence.\n",

    "In this paper, aiming at automatic estimation of naturalness in timing control of non-native's speech, we have analyzed the timing characteristics of non-native's speech to correlate with the corresponding subjective naturalness evaluation scores given by native speakers. Through statistical analyses using English speech data spoken by Japanese with temporal naturalness scores ranging one to five given by natives, we found high correlation between their scores and the differences from native's speech. These analyses provided a linear regression model where naturalness in timing control is estimated by differences from native's speech in durations of overall sentences, individual content and function words and pauses. The proposed naturalness evaluation model was tested its estimation accuracy using open data. The root mean square errors 0.64 between scores predicted by the model and those given by the natives turned out to be comparable to the differences 0.85 of scores among native listeners. Good correlation between model prediction and native's judgments confirmed the appropriateness of the proposed model.\n",

Three types of acoustic parameters are proposed: one related to pitch movement within the phrase final, one related to pitch reset prior to the phrase final, and one related to the length of the phrase final. A classification tree is used to evaluate automatic categorization of phrase final tone types, resulting in 76% correct classification for the best combination among the proposed acoustic parameters. Experiments are also conducted to verify the perceived degree of pitch change within a phrase final, and the perceived degree of pitch reset. While a good relationship is found between the perceptual scores and some of the acoustic parameters, our results also advocate a continuous rather than a categorical relationship between some of the phrase final tone-types considered.\n",

In order to combine efficiently distant and classical models, an adaptation of the back-off principle is made. Also, we show the importance of each part of a history for the prediction. In fact, each sub-history is analyzed in order to estimate its importance in terms of prediction and then a weight is associated to each class of sub-histories. Therefore, the combined models take into account the features of each history's part and not the whole history as made in other works. The contribution of distant n-gram models in terms of perplexity is significant and improves the results by 12.8%. Making the linear combination depending on sub-histories achieves an improvement of 5.3% in comparison to classical linear combination.\n",

    "Using a connectionist model as one of the components of the Structured Language Model has lead to significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate, mainly because of the connectionist model's power in using longer contexts and its ability in fighting the data sparseness problem. For its training, the SLM needs the syntactical parses of the word strings in the training data, provided by either humans or an external parser. In this paper we study the effect of training the connectionist based language model on the hidden parses hypothesized by the SLM itself. Since multiple partial parses are constructed for each word position, the model and the log-likelihood function will be in a form that necessitates a specific manner of training of the connectionist model. Experiments on the UPENN section of the Wall Street Journal corpus show significant improvements in perplexity.\n",

In this architecture, a hierarchical back-off mechanism is introduced to improve system robustness. Detailed topic models are applied when topic detection is confident, and wider models that cover multiple topics are applied in cases of uncertainty. In this paper, two topic detection methods are evaluated for the architecture: unigram likelihood and SVM (Support Vector Machine). On the ATR Basic Travel Expression corpus, both topic detection methods provide a comparable reduction in WER of 10.0% and 11.1% respectively over a single language model system. Finally the proposed re-decoding approach is compared with an equivalent system based on re-scoring. It is shown that re-decoding is vital to provide optimal recognition performance.\n",

The method is based on first interpreting conventional linear predictive (LP) analyses of successive prediction orders with parallel structures using the concept of symmetric linear prediction. In these implementations, symmetric linear prediction is preceded by simple pre-filters, which are of either low or high frequency characteristics. Combining those symmetric linear predictors that are not preceded by high-frequency pre-filters yields the LPLE predictor. It is proved that the all-pole filters computed by LPLE are always stable. The results show that the method is well-suited when low-order all-pole models with improved modeling of the lowest formants are needed.\n",

Experimental results show that each speech excitation parameter contour can be well described by a set of excitation targets using the event functions obtained from TD analysis of line spectral frequency (LSF) parameters, with considerably low reconstruction error.

    "We propose a novel model-based HMM distance computation framework to estimate run-time recognition errors and adapt recognition parameters without the need of using any testing or adaptation data. The key idea is to use HMM distances between competing models to measure the confusability between phones in speech recognition. Starting with a set of simulated models in a given noise condition, the corresponding error rate could be estimated with a smooth approximation of the error count computed form the set of phone distances without using any testing data. By minimizing the estimated error between the desired and simulated models, the target model parameters could also be adjusted without using any adaptation data. Experimental results show that the word errors, estimated with the proposed framework, closely resemble the errors obtained by running actual recognition experiments on a large testing set in a number of adverse conditions. The adapted models also gave better recognition performances than those obtained with environment-matched models, especially in low signal-to-noise conditions.\n",

    "This paper presents an analysis method of voice source characteristics from speech by simultaneously employing models of the vocal tract and voice source signal. The vocal tract is represented as a linear filter based on the conventional all-pole assumption. On the other hand, the voice source signal is represented by linearly overlapping multiple number of base signals obtained from a generalization of the Rosenberg model. The resulting voice source model is a polynomial function of time and has lesser degrees-of-freedom than the polynomial order. By virtue of the linearity of both models, the optimal values of their parameters can be jointly determined when the instants of the glottal opening and closing are given for each pitch period. We also present a temporal search method of these glottal events using the dynamic programming technique. Finally, experimental results are presented to reveal the applicability of the proposed method for several phonation conditions.\n",

    "This paper presents a novel method for tone pattern discrimination derived by combining a functional fundamental frequency (F_0) model for feature extraction with vector quantization and maximum likelihood estimation techniques. Tone patterns are represented in a parametric form based on the F_0 model and clustered using the LBG algorithm. The mapping between lexical tones and acoustic patterns is statistically modeled and decoded by the maximum likelihood estimation. Evaluation experiments are conducted on 469 Mandarin utterances (1.4 hours of read speech from a female native) with varied analysis conditions of codebook sizes and tone contexts. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the method in both tone discrimination and detection of the inconsistency between a lexical tone and its F_0 pattern. The method is suitable for the prosodic labeling of a large scale speech corpus.\n",

    "An extension to the conventional speech / nonspeech classification framework is presented for a scenario in which a number of microphones record the activity of speakers present at a meeting (one microphone per speaker). Since each microphone can receive speech from both the participant wearing the microphone (local speech) and other participants (crosstalk), the recorded audio can be broadly classified in four ways: local speech, crosstalk plus local speech, crosstalk alone and silence. We describe a classifier in which a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to model each class. A large set of potential acoustic features are considered, some of which have been employed in previous speech / nonspeech classifiers. A combination of two feature selection algorithms is used to identify the optimal feature set for each class. Results from the GMM classifier using the selected features are superior to those of a previously published approach.\n",

Discriminative transformations were based on linear discriminant analysis and multilayer perceptron networks. The acoustic models were trained using a subset of HUB5 training data and they were tested using OGI Numbers corpus. Baseline feature vector consisted of PLP cepstrum and energy with first and second order deltas. None of the feature transformations could outperform the baseline when used alone, but improvement in the word error rate was gained when the baseline feature was combined with the feature transformation stream. Two combination methods were experimented: feature vector concatenation and n-best list combination using ROVER. Best results were obtained using the combination of the baseline PLP cepstrum and the feature transform based on multilayer perceptron network. The word error rate in the number recognition task was reduced from 4.1 to 3.1.\n",

Using the PRAAT software and removing segmental information humming experiments of extracted intonation groups ending in interrogative and declarative intonations in both complete and edited forms were used. Results showed that (1.)phrasal or sentential intonation contour is less significant for Mandarin, (2.) yes-no questions with utterance question particles are characterized by a rising pitch on the final syllable only, (3.) the general higher register exhibited in yes-no questions without utterance final question particles is not the most salient cue for intonation, (4.) utterance final lengthening appears to be a salient perceptual cue for intonation identification, (5.) speech units larger than single sentences deserve more attention.\n",

One example application is a speaker recognition system, in which reduced-dimension log-spectral features based on MPEG-7 descriptors are used to train hidden Markov models for individual speakers. The feature extraction based on MPEG-7 descriptors consists of three main stages: Normalized Audio Spectrum Envelope (NASE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). An experimental study is presented where the speaker recognition rates are compared for different feature extraction methods. Using ICA, we achieved better results than NASE and PCA in a speaker recognition system.\n",

The voicing measure was combined with the standard Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) using linear discriminant analysis to choose the most relevant features. Experiments have been performed on small and large vocabulary tasks. The three different voicing measures combined with MFCCs resulted in similar improvements in word error rate: improvements of up to 14% on the small-vocabulary task and improvements of up to 6% on the large-vocabulary task relative to using MFCC alone with the same overall number of parameters in the system.\n",

The algorithm exploits that feature by dynamically updating the threshold as a non-linear average value computed during the preceding pause.

    "Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in its original model-free formulation is best suited to classification problems with equal-covariance classes. Heteroscedastic discriminant analysis (HDA) removes this equal covariance constraint, and therefore is more suitable for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. However, maximizing HDA objective function does not correspond directly to minimizing the recognition error. In its original formulation, HDA solves a maximum likelihood estimation problem in the original feature space to calculate the HDA transformation matrix. Since the dimension of the original feature space in ASR problems is usually high, the estimation of the HDA transformation matrix becomes computationally expensive and requires a large amount of training data. This paper presents a generalization of LDA that solves these two problems. We start with showing that the calculation of the LDA projection matrix is a maximum mutual information estimation problem in the lower-dimensional space with some constraints on the model of the joint conditional and unconditional probability density functions (PDF) of the features, and then, by relaxing these constraints, we develop a dimensionality reduction approach that maximizes the conditional mutual information between the class identity and the feature vector in the lower-dimensional space given the recognizer model. Using this approach, we achieved 1% improvement in phoneme recognition accuracy compared to the baseline system. Improvement in recognition accuracy compared to both LDA and HDA approaches is also achieved.\n",

Classical methods that are efficient in conventional feature extraction approaches showed not to be suitable to approximate temporal trajectories of speech.

    "Current Automatic Speech Recognition systems convert the speech signal into a sequence of discrete units, such as phonemes, and then apply statistical methods on the units to produce the linguistic message. Similar methodology has also been applied to recognize speaker and language, except that the output of the system can be the speaker or language information. Therefore, we propose the use of temporal trajectories of fundamental frequency and short-term energy to segment and label the speech signal into a small set of discrete units that can be used to characterize speaker and/or language. The proposed approach is evaluated using the NIST Extended Data Speaker Detection task and the NIST Language Identification task.\n",

    "Feature representation is a very important factor that has great effect on the performance of speech recognition systems. In this paper we focus on a feature generation process that is based on linear transformation of the original log-spectral representation. We first discuss several three popular linear transformation methods, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We then propose a new method of linear transformation that maximizes the normalized acoustic likelihood of the most likely state sequences of training data, a measure that directly related to our ultimate objective of reducing Bayesian classification error rate in speech recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed method decreases the relative word error rate by more than 8.8% compared to the best implementation of LDA, and by more than 25.9% compared to MFCC features.\n",

    "We present a generative factor analyzed hidden Markov model (GFA-HMM) for automatic speech recognition. In a traditional HMM, the observation vectors are represented by mixture of Gaussians (MoG) that are dependent on discrete-valued hidden state sequence. The GFA-HMM introduces a hierarchy of continuous-valued latent representation of observation vectors, where latent vectors in one level are acoustic-unit dependent and the latent vectors in a higher level are acoustic-unit independent. An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is derived for maximum likelihood parameter estimation of the model. The GFA-HMM can achieve a much more compact representation of the intra-frame statistics of observation vectors than traditional HMM. We conducted an experiment to show that the GFA-HMM can achieve better performances over traditional HMM with the same amount of training data but much smaller number of model parameters.\n",

    "Motivated by the temporal processing properties of human hearing, researchers have explored various methods to incorporate temporal and contextual information in ASR systems. One such approach, TempoRAl PatternS (TRAPS), takes temporal processing to the extreme and analyzes the energy pattern over long periods of time (500 ms to 1000 ms) within separate critical bands of speech. In this paper we extend the work on TRAPS by experimenting with two novel variants of TRAPS developed to address some shortcomings of the TRAPS classifiers. Both the Hidden Activation TRAPS (HATS) and Tonotopic Multi- Layer Perceptrons (TMLP) require 84% less parameters than TRAPS but can achieve significant phone recognition error reduction when tested on the TIMIT corpus under clean, reverberant, and several noise conditions. In addition, the TMLP performs training in a single stage and does not require critical band level training targets. Using these variants, we find that approximately 20 discriminative temporal patterns per critical band is sufficient for good recognition performance. In combination with a conventional PLP system, these TRAPS variants achieve significant additional performance improvements.\n",

    "Information concerning the identity of subword units such as phones cannot easily be pinpointed because it is broadly distributed in time and frequency. Continuing earlier work, we use Mutual Information as measure of the usefulness of individual time-frequency cells for various speech classification tasks, using the hand-annotations of the TIMIT database as our ground truth. Since different broad phonetic classes such as vowels and stops have such different temporal characteristics, we examine mutual information separately for each class, revealing structure that was not uncovered in earlier work; further structure is revealed by aligning the time-frequency displays of each phone at the center of their hand-marked segments, rather than averaging across all possible alignments within each segment. Based on these results, we evaluate a range of vowel classifiers over the TIMIT test set and show that selecting input features according to the mutual information criteria can provides a significant increase in classification accuracy.\n",

    "Voice conversion consists in transforming a source speaker voice into a target speaker voice. There are many applications of voice conversion systems where the amount of training data from the source speaker and the target speaker is different. Usually, the amount of source data available is large, but it is desired to estimate the transformation with a small amount of target data. Systems based on joint Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are well suited to voice conversion [1], but they can't deal with source data without its corresponding aligned target data. In this paper, two alternatives are studied to incorporate unaligned source data in the estimation of a GMM for a voice conversion task. It is shown that when a limited amount of aligned parameters are available in the training step, to only include data from the source speaker increases the performance of the voice transformation.\n",

We also derive a Viterbi-type training algorithm for the trajectory HMM. A preliminary speech recognition experiment based on N-best rescoring demonstrates that the training algorithm can improve the recognition performance significantly even though the trajectory HMM has the same parameterization as the standard HMM.\n",

    "When a speech recognition system has to work with signals corresponding to different sampling frequencies, multiple acoustic models may have to be maintained. To avoid this drawback, the system can be trained at the highest expected sampling frequency and the acoustic models are posteriorly converted to a new sampling frequency. However, the usual mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are not well suited to this approach since they are not located in the frequency domain. For this reason, we propose in this paper to face that problem with the features resulting from frequency-filtering the logarithmic band energies. Experimental results are reported with SpeechDatCar databases, at 16 kHz, 11 kHz, and 8 kHz sampling rates, which show no degradation in terms of recognition performance for 11/8 kHz testing signals when the system, trained at 16 kHz, is converted, in an inexpensive way, to 11/8 kHz, instead of directly training the system at 11/8 kHz.\n",

    "The generation of naturally-sounding F0 contours in TTS enhances the intelligibility and perceived naturalness of synthetic speech. In earlier works the first author developed a linguistically motivated model of German intonation based on the quantitative Fujisaki model of the production process of F0, and an automatic procedure for extracting the parameters from the F0 contour which, however, was specific to German. As has been shown by Fujisaki and his co-workers, parametrization of F0 contours of Mandarin requires negative tone commands, as well as a more precise control of F0 associated with the syllabic tones. This paper presents an approach to the automatic parameter estimation for Mandarin, as well as first results concerning the accuracy of estimation. The paper also introduces a recently developed tool for editing Fujisaki parameters featuring resynthesis which will soon be publicly available.\n",

However, in contrast to the standard PoE model, the individual experts are not required to be valid distributions, thus allowing additional flexibility in the component priors and variances.

The proposed weighting will address the problems such as: harmonic estimation reliability, perceptual significance of the harmonic and the model mismatch errors. The robust estimator is proposed, to reduce the effect of outliers caused by spectral nulls or additive non-speech contributions (e.g. background noise or music). It is demonstrated that the proposed all-pole estimation can significantly improve the performance of speech coders based on sinusoidal model, since the harmonic magnitudes are modeled better by the WMSE all-pole model.\n",

Using the AR-filter parameter values obtained through the analysis, we can construct a vocoder-type formant synthesizer, where the residual waveform is used as the excitation source.

    "In this work we propose a time domain technique to estimate an all-pole model based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) using a warped short time frequency axis such as the Mel scale. The use of the MVDR eliminates the overemphasis of harmonic peaks typically seen in medium and high pitched voiced speech when spectral estimation is based on linear prediction (LP). Moreover, warping the frequency axis prior to MVDR spectral estimation ensures more parameters in the spectral model are allocated to the low, as opposed to high, frequency regions of the spectrum, thereby mimicking the human auditory system. In a series of speech recognition experiments on the Switchboard Corpus (spontaneous English telephone speech), the proposed approach achieved a word error rate (WER) of 32.1% for female speakers, which is clearly superior to the 33.2% WER obtained by the usual combination of Mel warping and linear prediction.\n",

In earlier work we showed that articulatory features can compensate for inter language variability and can be recognized across languages. In this paper we show that using cross- and multilingual detectors to support an HMM based speech recognition system significantly reduces the word error rate. By selecting and weighting the features in a discriminative way, we achieve an error rate reduction that lies in the same range as that seen when using language specific feature detectors. By combining feature detectors from many languages and training the weights discriminatively, we even outperform the case where only monolingual detectors are being used.\n",

    "In this work, machine learning techniques have been applied for the assessment of the relevance of several prosodic features in TTS for Spanish. Using a two step correspondence between sets of prosodic features and intonation parameters, the influence of the number of different intonation patterns and the number and order of prosodic features is evaluated. The output of the trained classifiers is proposed as a labelling mechanism of intonation units which can be used to synthesize high quality pitch contours. The input output correspondence of the classifier also provides a bundle of relevant prosodic knowledge.\n",

    "This paper presents a new method for robust voiced/unvoiced segment (V/UV) classification and accurate fundamental frequency (F_0) estimation in a noisy environment. For this purpose, we introduce the degree of dominance and dominance spectrum that are defined by instantaneous frequency. The degree of dominance allows us to evaluate the magnitude of individual harmonic components of speech signals relative to the background noise. The V/UV segments are robustly classified based on the capability of the dominance spectrum to extract the regularity in the harmonic structure. F_0 is accurately determined based on fixed points corresponding to dominant harmonic components easily selected from the dominance spectrum. Experimental results show that the present method is better than the existing methods in terms of gross and fine F_0 errors, and V/UV correct rates in the presence of background white and babble noise.\n",

Analysis-by-Synthesis of observed F_0 contours of a number of utterances by five native speakers indicated that the model with provisions for both positive and negative accent commands applies quite well to all the utterances tested. The estimated commands are found to be closely related to the linguistic contents of the utterances. One of the features of European Portuguese found in utterances by the majority of speakers is the occurrence of a negative accent command at certain phrase-initial positions, and its perceptual significance is examined by an informal listening test, using stimuli synthesized both with and without negative accent commands.\n",

    "Decomposition of speech signals into simultaneous streams of periodic and aperiodic information has been successfully applied to speech analysis, enhancement, modification and recently recognition. This paper examines the effect of different weightings of the two streams in a conventional HMM system in digit recognition tests on the Aurora 2.0 database. Comparison of the results from using matched weights during training showed a small improvement of approximately 10% relative to unmatched ones, under clean test conditions. Principal component analysis of the covariation amongst the periodic and aperiodic features indicated that only 45 (51) of the 78 coefficients were required to account for 99% of the variance, for clean (multi-condition) training, which yielded an 18.4% (10.3%) absolute increase in accuracy with respect to the baseline. These findings provide further evidence of the potential for harmonically-decomposed streams to improve performance and substantially to enhance recognition accuracy in noise. La descomposicion de senales del habla en flujos simultaneos de informacion periodica y aperiodica ha sido aplicada exitosamente al analisis, realce, modificacion y, recientemente, reconocimiento del habla. Este articulo examina el efecto de diferentes ponderaciones de estos dos flujos en un sistema `HMM' convencional de reconocimiento de digitos con la base de datos Aurora 2.0. Bajo condiciones de prueba no ruidosas, la comparacion de los resultados utilizando ponderaciones coincidentes durante entrenamiento y prueba mostro una pequena mejora relativa de aproximadamente un 10% con respecto al caso de utilizar ponderaciones solo en las puebas. El analisis de componentes principales de la covarianza entre los rasgos periodicos y aperiodicos indico que solo fueron requeridos 45 (51) de los 78 coeficientes para cubrir el 99% de la varianza, para entrenamento limpio (multicondicional), el cual produjo un incremento absoluto del 18.4% (10.3%) en exactitud con respecto a la prueba base. Estos descubrimientos proporcionan evidencias adicionales del potencial de los flujos descompuestos harmonicamente para dar mejoras en rendimiento y, sustancialmente, para realzar la exactitud del reconocimiento en ruido.\n",

    "In this paper, we present a beamforming based semi-blind source separation technique, which can be applied efficiently for hands-free speech recognition of multiple talkers (including moving talkers, too). The main difference from the conventional blind source separation techniques lies in the fact that the proposed method does not attempt to separate explicitly the unknown signals in a pre-processing pass before speech recognition. In fact, localization of multiple talkers, separation of the signals, and speech recognition are integrated in a single pass. Each time frame, beams formed by a delay-and-sum beamformer are steered to every direction, and speech information is extracted. A modified Viterbi formula provides n-best hypotheses for each direction and word hypotheses. At the final frame, all hypotheses are clustered based on their direction information. The clusters, which correspond to the talkers include information about the recognized speech of the multiple talkers and about their direction. Experiments for recognition of two and three talkers showed very promising results. In the case of two talkers, and using simulated clean data we achieved for `top 5' hypotheses a recognition rate of series 95.02% on average, which is very promising result.\n",

In order to efficiently beamform each moving speaker on an extended basis we adapt the theory developed in the context of Multi-target Tracking for military and civilian applications to the context of microphone array. Our approach employs Wideband MUSIC and Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimators to estimate the DOAs of the speakers under different kinds of motion and sudden change in their course. Probabilistic Data Association (PDA) is used to disambiguate and resolve DOA measurements.

    "There are few works on the problem of heavy noise corruption in wavelet-based speech enhancement. In this paper, a new method is introduced to adapt the weighting function for wavelet coefficients (WCs) in each subband. The idea is based on that the change of WC variance in speech-dominated frames is larger than the change of WC variance in noise-dominated frames. We can define a weighting function for WCs in each subband so that WCs are preserved in speech-dominated frames and reduced in noise-dominated frames. Then a weighting function in terms of WC's variance is derived. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more robust than that of SNR adjusted speech enhancement system.\n",

    "The subject of this work is the use of microphone arrays for speech activity detection and noise suppression in the case of a moving speaker. The approach is based on the generalized likelihood ratio test applied to the framework of far-field, wideband moving sources (W-GLRT). It is shown that under certain distributional assumptions the W-GLRT provides a unifying framework for evaluation of Direction of Arrival (DOA) measurements against spurious DOAs, probabilistic speech activity detection as well as noise suppression. As regards speech enhancement, we demonstrate the direct connection of W-GLRT with enhancement based on subspace methods. In addition, through the concept of directive a-priori SNR we demonstrate its indirect connection with Minimum Mean Square Error spectral (MMSE_SA) and log-spectral gain modification (MMSE_LSA). The efficiency of the approach is illustrated on a moving speaker where additive white Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is present in the acoustical field at very low SNRs.\n",

    "Microphone arrays are powerful tools for noise suppression in a reverberant room. Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC) that exploits Minimum Variance (MV) criterion is efficient in interference suppression when there is no correlation between the desired signal and the interferences. Correlation between the desired signal and any of interference produces a desired signal cancellation and degradation of signal-to-noise ratio. This paper analyses the unwanted cancellation of the desired source. It shows that cancellation level of the desired signal is proportional to the correlation between the direct wave and the reflected waves. For prevention of a desired signal cancellation we suggest the GSC parameter estimation during the pauses of the desired signal. For this case it is analytically shown that there is no cancellation of the desired signal. The proposed algorithm was experimentally tested and compared with the Conventional Beamformer (CBF) and GSC. Experimental tests have shown the advantage of the proposed method.\n",

Both subjective listening tests and spectrogram-plot comparison showed that the closed-form solution developed here can offer significantly better speech quality than either the conventional spectral subtraction algorithm or the previously proposed GSVD-based technique, regardless of whether the additive noise is white or not.\n",

The hoarse characteristics are reduced by re-synthesizing the CELP reproduced speech with harmonic plus noise model. The pair-wise listening experiment results show that the re-synthesized wideband speech is preferred over the CELP coded speech.

The noise reduced features are transmitted with some parameters, viz., pitch period, the number of harmonic peaks from the mobile terminal to the server along noise-robust mel-frequency cepstral coefficients.

The system is based on an auditory vocoder developed to resynthesize speech from an auditory Mellin representation using the vocoder STRAIGHT. The auditory representation preserves fine temporal information, unlike conventional window-based processing, and this makes it possible to segregate speech sources with an event synchronous procedure. We developed a method to convert fundamental frequency information to estimate glottal pulse times so as to facilitate robust extraction of the target speech. The results show that the segregation is good even when the SNR is 0 dB; the extracted target speech was a little distorted but entirely intelligible, whereas the distracter speech was reduced to a non-speech sound that was not perceptually disturbing. So, this auditory vocoder has potential for speech enhancement in applications such as hearing aids.\n",

The proposed method is based on the introduction of a non-subtractive noise suppression model and multi band filter gain control. This model provides less residual noise and better speech quality over the Spectral Subtraction Method (SSM). Modification of multi-band AGC gain function allows easy introduce new useful feature called Spectral Contrasting. The report contains the discussion of AGC control parameters values.

    "A new speech enhancement system, which is based on a time-frequency adaptive wavelet soft thresholding, is presented in this paper. The system utilises a Bark-scaled wavelet packet decomposition integrated into a modified Weiner filtering technique using a novel threshold estimation method based on a magnitude decision-directed approach. First, a Bark-Scaled wavelet packet transform is used to decompose the speech signal into critical bands. Threshold estimation is then performed for each wavelet band according to an adaptive noise level-tracking algorithm. Finally, the speech is estimated by incorporating the computed threshold into a Wiener filtering process, using the magnitude decision-directed approach. The proposed speech enhancement technique has been tested with various stationary and non-stationary noise cases. Reported results show that the system is capable of a high-level of noise suppression while preserving the intelligibility and naturalness of the speech.\n",

We approximate noise spectral magnitude from available recordings from the operational environment as well as clean speech from a clean database with mixtures of Gaussian pdfs using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM). Subsequently, we apply the Bayesian inference framework to the degraded spectral coefficients and by employing Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation (MMSE) we derive a closed form solution for the spectral magnitude estimation task. We evaluate our technique with a focus on real, highly non-stationary noise types (e.g. passing-by aircraft noise) and demonstrate its efficiency at low SNRs.\n",

    "This paper introduces a novel speech enhancement system based on a wavelet denoising framework. In this system, the noisy speech is first preprocessed using a generalized spectral subtraction method to initially lower the noise level with negligible speech distortion. A perceptual wavelet transform is then used to decompose the resulting speech signal into critical bands. Threshold estimation is implemented that is both time and frequency dependent, providing robustness to non-stationary and correlated noisy environments. Finally, to eliminate the \"musical noise\" artifact, we apply a modified Ephraim/Malah suppression rule to the thresholding operation - adaptive denoising. Both objective and subjective experiments prove that the new speech enhancement system is capable of significant noise reduction with little speech distortion.\n",

Speech from multiple speakers is simultaneously collected over two spatially distributed microphones. Time-delay of each speaker with respect to the two microphones is estimated using the excitation source information. A weight function is derived for each speaker using the knowledge of the time-delay and the excitation source information. Linear prediction (LP) residuals of the microphone signals are processed separately using the weight functions. Speech signals are synthesized from the modified residuals. One speech signal per speaker is derived from each microphone signal. The synthesized speech signals of each speaker are combined to produce enhanced speech. Significant enhancement of the speech of one speaker relative to other was observed from the combined signal.\n",

This paper introduces a non-equally- spaced microphone arrangement, which might give more spatial information than equally-spaced microphones, with two criteria for selecting the most suitable paired-microphone. These criteria are based on noise reduction rate and spectral smoothness, assuming that objective signals are speech. The feasibility of both the non-equally-spaced array and the criterion on spectral smoothness are confirmed by computer simulation.\n",

    "One of the reasons that reverberation degrades speech intelligibility is the effect of overlap-masking, in which segments of an acoustic signal are affected by reverberation components of previous segments [Bolt et al., 1949]. To reduce the overlap-masking, Arai et al. suppressed steady-state portions having more energy, but which are less crucial for speech perception, and confirmed promising results for improving speech intelligibility [Arai et al., 2002]. Our goal is to provide a pre-processing filter for each auditorium. To explore the relationship between the effect of a pre-processing filter and reverberation conditions, we conducted a perceptual test with steady-state suppression under various reverberation conditions. The results showed that processed stimuli performed better than unprocessed ones and clear improvements were observed for reverberation conditions of 0.8 - 1.0s. We certified that steady-state suppression was an effective pre-processing method for improving speech intelligibility under reverberant conditions and proved the effect of overlap-masking.\n",

    "This paper presents a new voice conversion system that modifies misarticulations and prosodic deviations of the hearing-impaired Mandarin speech. The basic strategy is the detection and exploitation of characteristic features that distinguish the impaired speech from the normal speech at segmental and prosodic levels. For spectral conversion, cepstral coefficients were characterized under the form of a Gaussian mixture model with parameters converted using a mapping function that minimizes the spectral distortion between the impaired and normal speech. We also proposed a VQ-based approach to prosodic conversion that involves modifying the features extracted from the pitch contour by orthogonal polynomial transform. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system appears useful in enhancing the hearing-impaired Mandarin speech.\n",

    "Spectral subtraction (SS) approach has been widely used for speech enhancement and recognition accuracy improvement, but becomes less effective when the additive noise is not white. In this paper, we propose to integrate wavelet transform and the SS algorithm. The spectrum of the additive noise in each frequency band obtained in this way can then be better approximated as white if the number of bands is large enough, and therefore the SS approach can be more effective. Experimental results based on three objective performance measures and spectrogram-plot comparison show that this new approach can provide better performance especially when the noise is non-white. Listening test results also indicate that the new algorithm can give more preferable sound quality and intelligibility than the conventional spectral subtraction algorithm. Moreover, the new approach also offers some reductions of the computational complexity when compared with the conventional SS algorithm.\n",

This evaluation shows a satisfying restoration of the timbre for most speakers. For some speakers however, a noticeable spectral distortion remains. That is why we propose a multi-referenced equalizer, based on a classification of speakers and using a different reference spectrum for each class. This leads to a decrease of the spectral distortion and, as a consequence, to a significant improvement of the timbre correction.\n",

The proposed method cancels the powerful harmonic components of engine noise by adaptive filtering which utilizes the known rpm signal available on the CAN bus in modern cars. The procedure can be used as a preprocessing method for classical broad-band noise reduction as it is able to cancel the engine noise - and thus a large amount of low-frequent car noise - without provoking speech distortion. The main part of the paper is dedicated to the step-size control of the utilized LMS algorithm necessary for a complete cancellation of the harmonics without speech distortion. Therefore, first a theoretically optimal step-size is determined and then a procedure is described which allows its determination in real applications.

    "Usually the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) beamformer requires additional highpass pre-filtering due to insufficient suppression of low frequency directional interference, and it deteriorates the bandwidth quality of speech enhancement, especially for small size microphone array. This paper proposes a new GSC beamformer with multiple frequency dependent norm-constrained adaptive filters (FD-NCAF), which combine bin-wise constraint in low frequency band and norm constraint in high frequency band, to improve the performance of the adaptive interference canceller (AIC) for low frequency interference. Simulation on five testing signals shows that directional response of the proposed beamformer is less sensitive to the spectrum of interference than the full-band GSC. In the experiments based on real recordings, when the cut-off frequency of highpass pre-filtering extended to lower frequency, the residual directional interference of the full-band GSC will be increased by 3.37dB, while that of the proposed beamformer will be increased by only 0.95dB. Therefore, the passband of the proposed GSC beamformer can be extended without loss of performance.\n",

The a-priori information consists of speech and noise spectral shapes stored in trained codebooks. The excitation variances of speech and noise are determined through the optimization of a criterion that finds the best fit between the noisy observation and the model represented by the two codebooks. The optimal spectral shapes and variances are used in a Wiener filter to obtain an estimate of clean speech. The method uses both a-priori and estimated noise information to perform well in stationary as well as non-stationary noise environments. The high computational complexity resulting from a full search of joint speech and noise codebooks is avoided through an iterative optimization procedure. Experiments indicate that the method significantly outperforms conventional enhancement techniques, especially for non-stationary noise.\n",

Our discussion highlights the advantages of using an articulatory representation of speech. We then summarize mathematical results showing that, because articulator motions are bandlimited, a large class of mappings from articulation to acoustics can be blindly inverted. Simulation results showing the power of the inversion technique are also presented. One of the most interesting simulation results is that some many-to-one mappings can also be inverted. These results explain earlier experimental results that the studied technique can recover articulator positions. We conclude that our technique has many advantages for speech processing, including invariance with respect to various nonlinearities and the ability to exploit context more easily.\n",

    "The convergence rate of the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is dependent on the eigenvalue distribution of the reference input correlation matrix. When adaptive filters are employed in low-delay over-sampled subband structures, colored subband signals considerably decelerate the convergence speed. Here, we propose and implement two promising techniques for improving the convergence rate based on: 1) Spectral emphasis and 2) Decimation of the subband signals. We analyze the effects of the proposed methods based on theoretical relationships between eigenvalue distribution and convergence characteristics. We also propose a combined decimation and spectral emphasis whitening technique that exploits the advantages of both methods to dramatically improve the convergence rate. Moreover, through decimation the combined whitening approach reduces the overall computation cost compared to subband LMS with no pre-processing. Presented theoretical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed convergence improvement methods.\n",

    "This paper proposes a speech dereverberation method based on the MTF concept. This method can be used without measuring the impulse response of room acoustics. In the model, the power envelopes and carriers are decomposed from a reverberant speech signal using an N-channel filterbank and then are dereverberated in each respective channel. In the envelope dereverberation process, a power envelope inverse filtering method is used to dereverberate the envelopes. In the carrier regeneration process, a carrier generation method based on voiced/unvoiced speech from the estimated fundamental frequency (F0) is used. In this paper, we assume that F0 has been estimated accurately. We have carried out 15,000 simulations of dereverberation for reverberant speech signals to evaluate the proposed model. We found that the proposed model can accurately dereverberate not only the power envelopes but also the speech signal from the reverberant speech using regenerated carriers.\n",

    "A double-talk detector (DTD) is generally used with an acoustic echo canceller (AEC) in pinpointing the region where far-end and near-end signal coexist. This region is called double-talk and during this region AEC usually freezes the adaptation. Decision variable used in DTD has a relatively longer transient time going from double-talk to single-talk than time going in opposite direction. Therefore, using a single threshold to pinpoint the location of double-talk region can be difficult. In this paper, a DTD based on a novel state transition diagram and a decision variable which requires minimal computational overhead is proposed to improve the accuracy of pinpointing the location. The use of different thresholds according to the state helps the DTD locate double-talk region more accurately. The proposed DTD algorithm is evaluated by obtaining a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and is compared to that of Cho's DTD.\n",

    "This paper describes a new noise suppression scheme with the goal of improving speech-in-noise perception for hearing-impaired listeners. Following the work of Tsoukalas et al. (1997) [4], Arehart et al (2003) [3] implemented and evaluated a noise suppression algorithm based on an approach that used the auditory masked threshold in conjunction with a version of spectral subtraction to adjust the enhancement parameters based on the masked threshold of the noise across the frequency spectrum. That original formulation was based on masking properties of the normal auditory system, with its theoretical underpinnings based on MPEG-4 audio coding [6]. We describe here a revised formulation, which is more suitable for hearing aid applications and which addresses changes in masking that occur with cochlear hearing loss. In contrast to previous formulations, the algorithm described here is implemented with generalized minimum mean square error estimators, which provide improvements over spectral subtraction estimators [1]. Second, the frequency resolution of the cochlea is described with auditory filter equivalent rectangular bandwidths (ERBs) [2] rather than the critical band scale. Third, estimation of the auditory masked thresholds and masking spreading functions are adjusted to address elevated thresholds and broader auditory filters characteristic of cochlear hearing loss. Fourth, the current algorithm does not include the tonality offset developed for use in MPEG-4 audio coding applications. The scheme also shows an overall improvement of 11% in the Itakura-Saito distortion measure.\n",

    "In acoustic echo cancellation systems, some residual echo exists after the acoustic echo canceller (AEC) due to the fact that the adaptive filter does not model exactly the impulse response of the Loudspeaker-Enclosure-Microphone (LEM) path. This is specially important in feedback acoustic environments like speech reinforcement systems for cars where this residual echo can make the system become unstable. In order to suppress this residual echo remaining after the AEC, postfiltering is the most used technique. The optimal filter that ensures stability without attenuating the speech signal depends on the power spectral density (psd) of the residual echo that must be estimated. This paper presents a residual echo psd estimation method needed to obtain the optimal echo suppression filter in speech reinforcement systems for cars.\n",

    "The present public telephone networks trim o. the lowband (50-300 Hz) and the highband (3400-7000 Hz) components of sounds. As a result, telephone speech is characterized by thin and muffled sounds, and degraded speaker identification. The lowband components are deterministically recoverable, while the missing highband can be recovered statistically. We develop an equalizer to restore the lowband parts. The highband parts are filled in using a linear prediction approach. The highband excitation is generated using a bandpass envelope modulated Gaussian signal and the spectral envelope is generated using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The mean log-spectrum distortion decreases by 0.96 dB, comparing to a previous method using wideband reconstruction with a VQ codebook mapping algorithm. Informal subjective tests show that the reconstructed wideband speech enhances lowband sounds and regenerates realistic highband components.\n",

    "The performance of an echo canceller systems deployed in a practical communication environment (i.e. the presence of background noise and the possible double talk scenario) depends on an accurate Voice Activity Detector (VAD) and an effective filter coefficient adaptation strategies. Accuracy of the VAD, which affects the coefficient adaptation strategy, is itself affected by the presence of background noise. In this paper, a novel soft weighting approach is proposed to replace the VAD and filter coefficient adaptation strategy. The robustness of the echo canceller system is further improved through integrating it with a noise suppression algorithm. The integrated echo canceller and noise suppressor systems has shown excellent performances under double talk scenarios with SNR as low as 5 dB.\n",

    "A main task for computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) is to separate several concurrent speech sources. From psychoacoustics it is known that common onsets, common amplitude modulation and sound source direction are among the important cues which allow the separation for the human auditory system. A new algorithm for binaural signals is presented here, that performs statistical estimation of two speech sources by a state-space approach which integrates temporal and frequency-specific features of speech. It is based on a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) scheme and tracks magnitude spectra and direction on a frame-by-frame basis. First results for estimating sound source direction and separating the envelopes of two voices are shown. The results indicate that the algorithm is able to localize two superimposed sound sources in a time scale of 50 ms. This is achieved by integrating measured high-dimensional statistics of speech. Also, the algorithm is able to track the short-time envelope and the short-time magnitude spectra of both voices on a time scale of 10 - 40 ms. The algorithm presented in this paper is developed for but not restricted to use in binaural hearing aid applications, as it is based on two head-mounted microphone signals as input. It is conceptionally able to separate more than two voices and integrate additional cues.\n",

Confirmation strategies encapsulated in a high-level DiscourseManager determine the system's behaviour across transactional domains, while rules of thumb encapsulated in a suite of domain experts enable the system to guide the user towards completion of particular transactions. We describe the nature of the generic confirmation strategy and the domain experts' specialised dialogue behaviour. We describe how rules of thumb fire given certain combinations of user-supplied values - or in the light of the system's own interaction with its database.\n",

We are now developing a dialog system which can generate response timing in real time. In this paper, we introduce a response timing generator for such a dialog system. First, we analyzed conversations between two persons and extracted prosodic and linguistic information which had effects on the timing. Then we constructed a decision tree based on the features coming from the information and developed a timing generator using rules derived from the decision tree. The timing generator decides the action of the system at every 100ms in user's pause. We evaluated the timing generator by subjective and objective evaluation.\n",

A corpus of spontaneous human-computer interaction was collected at the Telecommunication museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Adult and children speakers were compared with respect to user behavior and strategies during error resolution. In this study, 16 adults and 16 children speakers were randomly selected from a corpus from almost 3.000 speakers. This sub-corpus was then analyzed in greater detail. Results indicate that adults and children use partly different strategies when their interactions with Pixie become problematic. Children tend to repeat the same utterance verbatim, altering certain phonetic features. Adults, on the other hand, often modify other aspects of their utterances such as lexicon and syntax. Results from the present study will be useful for constructing future spoken dialogue systems with improved error handling for adults as well as children.\n",

    "In spoken dialogue systems, sentence verification technique is very useful to avoid misunderstanding user's intention by rejecting out-of-domain or bad quality utterances. However, compared with word verification and concept verification, sentence verification has been seldom touched in the past. In this paper, we propose a sentence verification approach which uses discriminative features extracted from the edit operation sequence. Since the edit operation sequence indicates what kinds of errors (i.e., insertion, deletion and substitution errors) may occur in the hypothetical concept sequence, it conveys sentence-level information for evaluating the quality of system's interpretation for the user's utterance. In addition, a sentence verification criterion concerning precision and recall rates of hypothetical concepts is also proposed to pursue efficient and correct spoken dialogue interactions. Compared with the verification method using acoustic confidence measure, the proposed approach reduces 17.3% of errors.\n",

    "Recently, the performance of speech recognition was drastically improved, and the products with the interface based on speech recognition have been realized. However, when we communicate with computers through a speech interface, misrecognition is inevitable, and it is difficult to recover from it because of the immaturity of the interface. Users try to recover from misrecognition by a repetition of the same content. So, the detection of user's repetition is helpful for a system to detect its misunderstanding, and to recover from the misrecognition. In this paper, we assume the utterance which includes repetitions a correction and propose a method to detect correction utterances in spontaneously spoken dialog using a word spotting based on DTW (dynamic time warping) and N-best hypotheses overlapping measure. As a result, we achieved recall rate of 92.7% and precision of 89.1%. Moreover, we tried to improve recognition accuracy using the detection. Using the choice of vocabulary and grammar setup based on the detection, we achieved improvement in recognition performance from 42.7% to 50.0% for correction utterance and from 70.5% to 77.9% for non-correction utterance.\n",

CMs are derived for both the words output from the recogniser and for the routings themselves and are used to investigate improving both routing accuracy and routing confidence. Results are given for a 35 route retail store enquiry-point task. They suggest that although routing error is controlled by the recogniser error-rate, confidence in routing decisions can be improved using these techniques.\n",

    "In traditional language modeling word prediction is based on the local context (e.g. n-gram). In spoken dialog, language statistics are affected by the multidimensional structure of the human-machine interaction. In this paper we investigate the statistical dependencies of users' responses with respect to the system's and user's channel. The system channel components are the prompts' text, dialogue history, dialogue state. The user channel components are the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcriptions, the semantic classifier output and the sentence length. We describe an algorithm for language model rescoring using users' response classification. The user's response is first mapped into a multidimensional state and the state specific language model is applied for ASR rescoring. We present perplexity and ASR results on the How May I Help You ?^sm 100K spoken dialogs.\n",

    "This paper details our work in developing a technique which can automatically generate class n-gram language models from natural language (NL) grammars in dialogue systems. The procedure eliminates the need for double maintenance of the recognizer language model and NL grammar. The resulting language model adopts the standard class n-gram framework for computational efficiency. Moreover, both the n-gram classes and training sentences are enhanced with semantic/syntactic tags defined in the NL grammar, such that the trained language model preserves the distinctive statistics associated with different word senses. We have applied this approach in several different domains and languages, and have evaluated it on our most mature dialogue systems to assess its competitiveness with pre-existing n-gram language models. The speech recognition performances with the new language model are in fact the best we have achieved in both the JUPITER weather domain and the MERCURY flight reservation domain.\n",

    "This paper describes an approach for flexible speech act identification of spontaneous speech with disfluency. In this approach, semantic information, syntactic structure, and fragment features of an input utterance are statistically encapsulated into a proposed speech act hidden Markov model (SAHMM) to characterize the speech act. To deal with the disfluency problem in a sparse training corpus, an interpolation mechanism is exploited to re-estimate the state transition probability in SAHMM. Finally, the dialog system accepts the speech act with best score and returns the corresponding response. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approach using a spoken dialogue system for the air travel information service. A testing database from 25 speakers containing 480 dialogues including 3038 sentences was collected and used for evaluation. Using the proposed approach, the experimental results show that the performance can achieve 90.3% in speech act correct rate (SACR) and 85.5% in fragment correct rate (FCR) for fluent speech and gains a significant improvement of 5.7% in SACR and 6.9% in FCR compared to the baseline system without considering filled pauses for disfluent speech.\n",

    "We present dialogue control methods (the dual-cost method and the trial dual-cost method) that enable a spoken dialogue system to convey information to the user in as short a dialogue as possible depending on the speech recognition rate and the content of its database. Both methods control a dialogue so as to minimize the sum of two costs: the confirmation cost (C-cost) and the information transfer cost (I-cost). The C-cost is the length of a subdialogue for confirming a user query, and the I-cost is the length of a system response generated after the confirmations. The dual-cost method can avoid the unnecessary confirmations that are inevitable in conventional methods. The trial dual-cost method is an improved version of the dual-cost method. Whereas the dual-cost method has the limitation that it generates a system response based on only the content of a query that the user has acknowledged in the confirmation subdialogue, the trial dual-cost method does not. Dialogue experiments prove that the trial dual-cost method outperforms the dual-cost method and that both methods outperform conventional ones.\n",

The recognition errors, however, cannot be completely avoided with current speech recognition techniques. In this paper, we propose a robust recognition understanding technique based on expected discourse plans in order to improve a recognition accuracy. First, we collect dialogue examples of elderly users through a Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) experiment. Next, we conduct a recognition experiment for collected elderly speech using the proposed technique. The experimental result demonstrates that this technique improved a sentence recognition rate from 69.1% to 74.3%, a word recognition rate from 80.3% to 81.7% , and a plan matching rate from 88.3% to 92.0%.\n",

All of these tasks are of information retrieval nature. The domain of a particular utterance is determined based on the likelihood of each speech recognizer. In addition to the human-machine interaction, synthesized voice of the route sub-system interrupts the dialogue frequently.

Through this approach it's more simple and rapid to adapt a Chinese spoken dialog system to a new task. Two different tasks, the train ticket reservation and the park guide are selected respectively as the target task in the experiments. The consistent reductions of perplexity and character error rate are observed during the adaptation.\n",

Such methods include case frame conversion, template-based text generation and topic frame driven dialog control scheme. The former two methods are for improving the portability across languages, and the last one is for improving the portability across domains. The case frame conversion is used for translating a source language case frame into a pivot language one. The template-based text generation is used for generating text responses in a particular language from abstract responses. The topic frame driven dialog control scheme makes it possible to manage mixed-initiative dialog based on a set of task-dependent topic frames. The experiments showed that the proposed methods could be used to improve the portability of a dialog system across domains and languages.\n",

    "This paper describes the dynamic, multi-lingual lexicon that was developed in the SmartKom project. SmartKom is a multimodal dialogue system that is supposed to assist the user in many applications which are characterised by their highly dynamic contents. Because of this dynamic nature various modules of the dialogue ranging from speech recognition over analysis to synthesis need to have one common knowledge source that takes care of the dynamic vocabularies that need to be processed. This central knowledge source is the lexicon. It is able to dynamically add and remove new words and generate the pronunciations for these words. We also describe the class-based language model (LM) that is used in SmartKom and that is closely coupled with the lexicon. Also evaluation results for this LM are given. Furthermore we describe our approach to dynamically generate pronunciations and give experimental results for the different classifiers we trained for this task.\n",

    "This paper describes a method for creating an evaluation measure for discourse understanding in spoken dialogue systems. Discourse understanding means utterance understanding taking the context into account. Since the measure needs to be determined based on its correlation with the system's performance, conventional measures, such as the concept error rate, cannot be easily applied. Using the multiple linear regression analysis, we have previously shown that the weighted sum of various metrics concerning dialogue states can be used for the evaluation of discourse understanding in a single domain. This paper reports the progress of our work: verification of our approach by additional experiments in another domain. The support vector regression method performs better than the multiple linear regression method in creating the measure, indicating non-linearity in mapping the metrics to the system's performance. The results give strong support for our approach and hint at its suitability as a universal evaluation measure for discourse understanding.\n",

    "For the evaluation of a speech-driven telephone flight information service we applied the PARADISE model developed by Walker and colleagues [1] in order to gain insight into the factors affecting the user satisfaction of this service. We conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to call the service and book a flight. During the telephone conversations quantitative measures (e.g. total elapsed time, the number of system errors) were logged. After completion of the telephone calls, the participants judged some quality related aspects such as dialogue presentation and accessability of the system. These subjective measures together represent a value for user satisfaction. Using multivariate linear regression, it was possible to derive a performance function with user satisfaction as the dependent variable and a combination of objective measures as independent variables. The results of the regression analysis also indicated that an extended definition of user satisfaction including a subjective measure `Grade' provides a better prediction than the analysis based on the narrow definition used by Walker et al. Further, we investigated the correlation between the subjective measures by conducting a principal components analysis. The results showed that these measures fell into two groups. Implications are discussed.\n",

A laboratory experiment is described in which speech input, speech output, and confirmation characteristics of a restaurant information system were manipulated in a controlled way. Users' quality perceptions were collected by means of a specifically designed questionnaire. It is based on a recently developed taxonomy of quality aspects, and aims at capturing a multitude of perceptually relevant quality dimensions. Experimental results indicate that ASR performance affects a number of interaction parameters, and is a relatively well identifiable quality impact for the user. In contrast, speech output affects perceived quality on a number of different levels, up to global user satisfaction judgments. Potential reasons for these findings are discussed.\n",

    "Conversational Biometrics combines acoustic speaker verification with conversational knowledge verification to make a more accurate identity decision. To manage the added level of complexity that the multi-modal user recognition approach introduces, this paper proposes the use of verification policies, in the form of Finite State Machines, which can be used to program a policy manager. Once a verification policy is written, the policy manager interprets the policy on the fly, and at every turn in the session decides dynamically whether to accept the user, reject the user, or continue to interact and collect more data. The policy manager allows for any number of verification engines to be plugged-in, thereby adding to the flexibility of the framework. As a result, system developers have significant freedom to design user verification solutions, and a wide variety of application-specific, transaction-specific and user-specific constraints can be addressed using a generic system. The paper also describes a prototype implementation of a Conversational Biometrics solution with the proposed programmable policy manager.\n",

    "In this paper we describe a new framework of feature compensation for robust speech recognition. We introduce Delta-Cepstrum Normalization (DCN) that normalizes not only cepstral coefficients, but also their time-derivatives. In previous work, the mean and the variance of cepstral coefficients are normalized to reduce the irrelevant information, but such a normalization was not applied to time-derivative parameters because the reduction of the irrelevant information was not enough. However, Histogram Equalization provides better compensation and can be applied even to delta and delta-delta cepstra. We investigate various implementation of DCN, and show that we can achieve the best performance when the normalization of the cepstra and delta cepstra can be mutually interdependent. We evaluate the performance of DCN using speech data recorded by a PDA. DCN provides significant improvements compared to HEQ. We also examine the possibility of combining Vector Taylor Series (VTS) and DCN. Even though some combinations do not improve the performance of VTS, it is shown that the best combination gives better performance than VTS alone. Finally, the advantages of DCN in terms of the computation speed are also discussed.\n",

The results confirm that the proposed method is effective in recognizing noise-added speech under various noise conditions.\n",

    "Sub-band speech recognition approaches have been proposed for robust speech recognition, where full-band power spectra are divided into several sub-bands and then likelihoods or cepstral vectors of the sub-bands are merged depending on their reliability. In conventional sub-band approaches, correlations across the sub-bands are not modeled and the merging weights can only be set experientially or estimated during training procedures, which may not match observed data. The methods further degrade performance for clean speech. We proposed a novel sub-band approach, where frequency sub-bands are multiplied with weighting factors and merged, which considers sub-band dependence and proves to be more robust than both full-band and conventional sub-band approaches. And further the weighting factors can be obtained by using the maximum-likelihood estimation approaches in order to minimize the mismatch between the trained models and the observed features. Finally we evaluated our methods on both the Aurora2 task and the Resource Management task and showed improvement of performance on the two tasks consistently.\n",

    "This paper proposes an effective feature compensation scheme based on speech model for achieving robust speech recognition. Conventional model-based method requires off-line training with noisy speech database and is not suitable for online adaptation. In the proposed scheme, we can relax the off-line training with noisy speech database by employing the parallel model combination technique for estimation of correction factors. Applying the model combination process over to the mixture model alone as opposed to entire HMM makes the online model combination possible. Exploiting the availability of noise model from off-line sources, we accomplish the online adaptation via MAP(Maximum A Posteriori) estimation. In addition, the online channel estimation procedure is induced within the proposed framework. The representative experimental results indicate that the suggested algorithm is effective in realizing robust speech recognition under the combined adverse conditions of additive background noise and channel distortion.\n",

    "This paper reports our recent efforts to develop a unified, non-linear, stochastic model for estimating and removing the effects of additive noise on speech cepstra. The complete system consists of prior models for speech and noise, an observation model, and an inference algorithm. The observation model quantifies the relationship between clean speech, noise, and the noisy observation. Since it is expressed in terms of the log Mel-frequency filter-bank features, it is non-linear. The inference algorithm is the procedure by which the clean speech and noise are estimated from the noisy observation. The most critical component of the system is the observation model. This paper derives a new approximation strategy and compares it with two existing approximations. It is shown that the new approximation uses half the calculation, and produces equivalent or improved word accuracy scores, when compared to previous techniques.

    "The goal of this paper is to establish a robust methodology for forensic automatic speaker recognition (FASR) based on sound statistical and probabilistic methods, and validated using databases recorded in real-life conditions. The interpretation of recorded speech as evidence in the forensic context presents particular challenges. The means proposed for dealing with them is through Bayesian inference and corpus based methodology. A probabilistic model - the odds form of Bayes' theorem and likelihood ratio - seems to be an adequate tool for assisting forensic experts in the speaker recognition domain to interpret this evidence. In forensic speaker recognition, statistical modelling techniques are based on the distribution of various features pertaining to the suspect's speech and its comparison to the distribution of the same features in a reference population with respect to the questioned recording. In this paper, the state-of-the-art automatic, text-independent speaker recognition system, using Gaussian mixture model (GMM), is adapted to the Bayesian interpretation (BI) framework to estimate the within-source variability of the suspected speaker and the between-sources variability, given the questioned recording. This double-statistical approach (BI-GMM) gives an adequate solution for the interpretation of the recorded speech as evidence in the judicial process.\n",

    "The current development of automatic speaker recognition technology may provide a new method to augment or replace the traditional method offered by qualified experts using aural and spectrographic analysis. The most promising of these automated technologies are based on statistical hypothesis testing methods involving likelihood ratios. The null hypothesis is generated using a universal background model composed of a large population of speakers. However, techniques with excellent performance in standardized evaluations (NIST trials) may not work perfectly in the real world. By defining and controlling the input speech samples carefully, we show quantitative differences in performance for different factors affecting a speaker population, and discuss on-going efforts to improve the accuracy rate for use in real world conditions.

    "The most prominent part in forensic speech and audio processing is speaker recognition. In the world a number of approaches to forensic speaker recognition (FSR) have been developed, that are different in terms of technical procedures, methodology, instrumentation and also in terms of the probability scale on which the final conclusion is based. The BKA's approach to speaker recognition is a combination of classical phonetic analysis techniques including analytical listening by an expert and the use of signal processing techniques within an acoustic-phonetic framework. This combined auditory-instrumental method includes acoustic measurements of parameters which may be interpreted using statistical information on their distributions, e.g. probability distributions of average fundamental frequency for adult males and females, average syllable rates as indicators of speech rate, etc. In a voice comparison report the final conclusion is determined by a synopsis of the results from auditory and acoustic parameters, amounting to about eight to twelve on average, depending on the nature of the speech material. Results are given in the form of probability statements. The paper gives an overview of current procedures and specific problems of FSR.\n",

    "An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of retention interval, exposure duration and acoustic environment on speaker identification accuracy in voice line-ups. In addition, the relation between confidence assessments by participants and test assistant and identification accuracy was explored. A total of 361 participants heard a single target voice in one of four exposure conditions (short or long speech sample, recorded only indoors or indoors and outdoors). Half the participants were tested immediately after exposure to the target voice and half one week later. The results show that the target was correctly identified in 42% of cases. In the target-absent condition there were 51% false alarms. Acoustic environment did not affect identification accuracy. There was an interaction between speech duration and retention interval in the target-absent condition: after a one-week interval, listeners made fewer false identifications if the speech sample was long. No effects were found when participants were tested immediately. Only the confidence scores of the test assistant had predictive value. Taking the confidence score of the test assistant into account therefore increases the diagnostic value of the line-up.\n",

    "In this study we examine a number of characteristics of angry Hebrew speech. Whereas such studies are frequently carried out on acted speech, in this study we used recordings of participants in broadcasted, politically oriented talk shows. The recordings were audited and rated for anger content by 11 listeners. 12 utterances judged to contain angry speech were then analyzed along with 12 utterances from the same speakers that were judged to contain neutral speech. Various statistics of the F0 curve and spectral tilt were calculated and correlated with the degree of anger, giving a number of interesting results: for example, though pitch range was significantly correlated to anger in general, pitch range was significantly negative-correlated to the degree of anger. A separate test was conducted, judging only the textual content of the utterances, to examine the degree to which it influenced the listening tests. After neutralizing for the textual content, some of the acoustic measures became weaker predictors of anger, whereas mean F0 remained the strongest indicator of anger. Spectral tilt also showed a significant decrease in angry speech.\n",

We establish classification performance of emotional/stressful speech using an open speaker set with open test tokens. With the new frequency distribution based scheme, we obtain a relative detection error reduction of series 81.3% in stress speech, and a series 75.4% relative detection rate reduction in neutral speech detection error rate.

Unlike previous studies that focus on users' knowledge or typical kinds of users, the proposed user model is more comprehensive. Specifically, we set up three dimensions of user models: skill level to the system, knowledge level on the target domain and degree of hastiness. Moreover, the models are automatically derived by decision tree learning using real dialogue data. We obtained reasonable classification accuracy for all dimensions. Dialogue strategies based on the user modeling are implemented in Kyoto city bus information system that has been developed at our laboratory. Experimental evaluation shows that the cooperative responses adaptive to individual users serve as good guidance for novice users without increasing the dialogue duration for skilled users.\n",

    "This paper describes recent advances we have made towards the goal of empowering end users to automatically expand the knowledge base of a dialogue system through spoken interaction, in order to personalize it to their individual needs. We describe techniques used to incrementally reconfigure a preloaded trained natural language grammar, as well as the lexicon and language models for the speech recognition system. We also report on advances in the technology to integrate a spoken pronunciation with a spoken spelling, in order to improve spelling accuracy. While the original algorithm was designed for a \"speak and spell\" input mode, we have shown here that the same methods can be applied to separately uttered spoken and spelled forms of the word. By concatenating the two waveforms, we can take advantage of the mutual constraints realized in an integrated composite FST. Using an OGI corpus of separately spoken and spelled names, we have demonstrated letter error rates of under 6% for in-vocabulary words and under 11% for words not contained in the training lexicon, a 44% reduction in error rate over that achieved without use of the spoken form. We anticipate applying this technique to unknown words embedded in a larger context, followed by solicited spellings.\n",

An integrated tutoring system teaches the use of a system to a user while he/she is using the system in a typical manner. Furthermore, we introduce the general principles of how to implement applications with integrated tutoring agents and present an example implementation for an existing e-mail system. The main innovation of the approach is that the tutoring agents are part of the application, but implemented in a way which makes it possible to plug them into the system without modifying it. This is possible due to a set of small, stateless agents and a shared Information Storage provided by our system architecture. Integrated tutoring agents are easily expandable and configurable, and general agents can be shared between applications. We have also received positive feedback about integrated tutoring in initial user tests conducted with the implementation.\n",

    "Verification problems are usually posted as a 2-class problem and the objective is to verify if an observation belongs to a class, say, A or its complement A'. However, we find that in a computer-assisted language learning application, because of the relatively low reliability of phoneme verification - with an equal-error-rate of more than 30% - a system built on conventional phoneme verification algorithm needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose to cast the problem as a 3-class verification problem with the addition of an \"in-between\" class besides A and A'. As a result, there are two thresholds to be designed in such a system. Although one may determine the two thresholds independently, better performance can be obtained by a joint estimation of these thresholds by allowing small deviation from the specified false acceptance and false rejection rates. This paper describes a cost-based approach to do that. Furthermore, issues such as per-phoneme thresholds vs. phoneme-class thresholds, and the use of bagging technique to improve the stability of thresholds are investigated. Experimental results on a kids' corpus show that cost-based thresholds and bagging improve verification performance.\n",

As well as serving this purpose, these confidence measures will help the system suggest a new local graph of hypotheses for the markovian segmentation system. We propose a new formulation of a frame-based posterior probability confidence measure which gives the best results for all of our experiments over a bench of six confidence measures. Adopting an hypothesis testing formulation, this posterior frame-based measure gives an EER of 12% for a randomly blurred test database.\n",

    "In speech recognition domain knowledge is usually implemented by training specialized acoustic and language models. This requires large amounts of training data for the domain. When such data is not available there often still exists external knowledge, obtainable through other means, that might be used to constrain the search for likely utterances. This paper presents a number of methods to exploit such knowledge; an adaptive language model and a lattice rescoring approach based on Bayesian updating. To decide whether external knowledge is applicable a word level confidence measure is implemented. As a special case of the general problem station-to-station travel frequencies are considered to improve recognition accuracy in a train table dialog system. Experiments are described that test and compare the different techniques.\n",

    "Isolated Word Verification (IWV) is the task of verifying the occurrence of a keyword at a specified location within a speech stream. Typical applications of IWV are to reduce the number of incorrect results output by a speech recognizer or keyword spotter. Such algorithms are also vital in reducing the false alarm rate in many commercial applications of speech recognition, such as automated telephone transaction systems and audio database search engines. In this paper, we propose a new method of isolated word verification that we call Cohort Word-level Verification (CWV). The CWV method attempts to increase IWV performance by incorporating higher level linguistic and word level information into the selection of non-keyword models for verification. When used in conjunction with speech background model based IWV, we are able to achieve significant performance improvements for IWV of short words.\n",

    "In many telephony applications that use speech recognition, it is important to identify and reject out-of-vocabulary words or utterances without keywords by means of utterance verification (UV). Typically, UV is performed based on the likelihood ratio of the target model versus an alternative model. The \"goodness\" of the models and the particular criteria used for estimating these models can have significant impact on its performance. Because the UV problem can be considered as a two-class classification problem, minimum classification error (MCE) training is a natural choice. Earlier work has focused on MCE training to reduce total classification errors. In this paper, we extend the MCE approach to minimize the error rates. In particular, we focus on the error rates at certain operating points and show how this can result in a significant EER reduction for phone verification on the TIMIT and a non-native kids corpus. While the particular technique is developed on utterance verification, it can also be generalized for other verification tasks such as speaker verification.\n",

    "Our new experimental results, presented in this paper, clearly prove the dependence between word graph density and the quality of two different confidence measures. Both confidence measures are based on the computation of the posterior probabilities of the hypothesized words and apply the time alignment information of the word graph for confidence score accumulation. We show that the quality of the confidence scores of both confidence measures significantly increases for higher word graph densities. The analyses were carried out on two different German spontaneous speech corpora: on the Verbmobil evaluation corpus [1] and on the NaDia corpus. We achieved a relative reduction of the confidence error rate by up to 41.4%, compared to the baseline confidence error rate. The results lead us to propose to perform the confidence score calculation - based on posterior probability accumulation - on higher word graph densities in order to get the best results.\n",

    "The task of keyword spotting is to detect a set of keywords in the input continuous speech. In a keyword spotter, not only the keywords, but also the non-keyword intervals must be modeled. For this purpose, filler (or garbage) models are used. To date, most of the keyword spotters have been based on hidden Markov models (HMM). More specifically, a set of HMM is used as garbage models. In this paper, a two-pass keyword spotting technique based on bilingual hidden Markov models is presented. In the first pass, our technique uses phonemic garbage models to represent the non-keyword intervals, and in the second stage the putative hits are verified using normalized scores. The main difference from similar approaches lies in the way the non-keyword intervals are modeled. In this work, the target language is Japanese, and English was chosen as the `garbage' language for training the phonemic garbage models. Experimental results on both clean and noisy telephone speech data showed higher performance compared with using a common set of acoustic models. Moreover, parameter tuning (e.g. word insertion penalty tuning) does not have a serious effect on the performance. For a vocabulary of 100 keywords and using clean telephone speech test data we achieved a 92.04% recognition rate with only a 7.96% false alarm rate, and without word insertion penalty tuning. Using noisy telephone speech test data we achieved a 87.29% recognition rate with only a 12.71% false alarm rate.\n",

    "In speech and language processing, information about the errors made by a learning system is commonly used to assess and improve its performance. Because of high computational complexity, the context of the errors is usually either ignored, or exploited in a simplistic form. The complexity becomes tractable, however, for phone recognition because of the small lexicon. For phone-based systems, an exhaustive modeling of local context is possible. Furthermore, recent research studies have shown phone recognition to be useful for several spoken language processing tasks. In this paper, we present a mechanism which learns patterns of context-sensitive errors from ASR-output aligned with the \"true\" phone transcriptions. We also show how this information, encoded as a context-sensitive weighted transducer, can provide a modest improvement to phone recognition accuracy even when no transcriptions are available for the domain of interest.\n",

    "We address the problem of estimating the word error rate (WER) of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system without using acoustic test data. This is an important problem which is faced by the designers of new applications which use ASR. Quick estimate of WER early in the design cycle can be used to guide the decisions involving dialog strategy and grammar design. Our approach involves estimating the probability distribution of the word hypotheses produced by the underlying ASR system given the text test corpus. A critical component of this system is a phonemic confusion model which seeks to capture the errors made by ASR on the acoustic data at a phonemic level. We use a confusion model composed of probabilistic phoneme sequence conversion rules which are learned from phonemic transcription pairs obtained by leave-one-out decoding of the training set. We show reasonably close estimation of WER when applying the system to test sets from different domains.\n",

We used five one-hour broadcast news shows for experiments, and the experimental results show that our method performs as well as the model-selection-based methods, but with a lower computation cost.\n",

A third system was developed that combines the scores from the acoustic and the linguistic systems in a Maximum-Likelihood framework. All systems outlined in this paper are essentially language-independent but all our experiments were conducted on the Arabic Broadcast News speech recognition transcripts. Our experiments show that while the acoustic system outperforms the linguistic system, the combined system achieves the best performance at detecting sentence boundaries.\n",

    "Digital archives have emerged as the pre-eminent method for capturing the human experience. Before such archives can be used efficiently, their contents must be described. The scale of such archives along with the associated content mark up cost make it impractical to provide access via purely manual means, but automatic technologies for search in spoken materials still have relatively limited capabilities. The NSF-funded MALACH project will use the world's largest digital archive of video oral histories, collected by the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation (VHF) to make a quantum leap in the ability to access such archives by advancing the state-of-the-art in Automated Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related technologies [1, 2]. This corpus consists of over 115,000 hours of unconstrained, natural speech from 52,000 speakers in 32 different languages, filled with disfluencies, heavy accents, age-related coarticulations, and un-cued speaker and language switching. This paper discusses some of the ASR and NLP tools and technologies that we have been building for the English speech in the MALACH corpus. We also discuss this new test bed while emphasizing the unique characteristics of this corpus.\n",

Different components are designed for different purposes in the system. Results show that detection of disfluency interruption points is best achieved by a combination of prosodic cues, word-based cues, and POS-based cues. The onset of a disfluency to be removed, in contrast, is best found using knowledge-based rules. Finally, specific disfluency types can be aided by the modeling of word patterns.\n",

In addition, features like articulatory movements, which are difficult or impossible to obtain during recognition, can be left hidden, in fact eliminating the need of their extraction.

    "One of the most serious problems in spontaneous speech recognition is the degradation of recognition accuracy due to the speaking rate fluctuation in an utterance. This paper proposes a method for adjusting mixture weights of an HMM frame by frame depending on the local speaking rate. The proposed method is implemented using the Bayesian network framework. A hidden variable representing the variation of the \"mode\" of the speaking rate is introduced and its value controls the mixture weights of Gaussian mixtures. Model training and maximum probability assignment of the variables are conducted using the EM/GEM and inference algorithms for Bayesian networks. The Bayesian network is used to rescore the acoustic likelihood of the hypotheses in N-best lists. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves word accuracy by 1.6% for the absolute value on meeting speech given the speaking rate information, whereas improvement by a regression HMM is less significant.\n",

In this paper, we present a new modelling approach, called SLGHMM, that uses a hybrid Dynamic Bayesian Network of SLG models and Continuous Density HMMs (CDHMMs) to compensate for the nonstationary distortion that may exist in speech utterance to be recognized. With this representation, the CDHMMs (each modelling mainly the linguistic information of a speech unit) and a set of linear Gaussian models (each modelling a kind of stationary distortion) can be jointly learnt from multi-condition training data. Such a SLGHMM is able to model approximately the distribution of speech corrupted by switching-condition distortions.

The features can be seen as the outputs of an array of band-pass filters spread over the cepstral modulation frequency range of interest.

    "This paper presents a novel compensation approach, which is implemented in both model and feature spaces, for non-stationary noise Due to the nature of non-stationary noise which can be decomposed into constant part and residual noise part, our proposed scheme is performed in two steps: before recognition, an extended Jacobian adaptation (JA) is applied to adapt the speech models for the constant part of noise; during recognition, the power spectra of noisy speech are compensated to eliminate the effect of residual noise part of noise. As verified by the experiments performed under different stationary and non-stationary noise environments, the proposed JA is superior to the basic JA and the joint approach is better than the compensation in single space.\n",

    "Kernel methods have found in recent years wide use in statistical learning techniques due to their good performance and their computational efficiency in high-dimensional feature space. However, text or speech data cannot always be represented by the fixed-length vectors that the traditional kernels handle. We recently introduced a general kernel framework based on weighted transducers, rational kernels, to extend kernel methods to the analysis of variable-length sequences and weighted automata [5] and described their application to spoken-dialog applications. We presented a constructive algorithm for ensuring that rational kernels are positive definite symmetric, a property which guarantees the convergence of discriminant classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, and showed that many string kernels previously introduced in the computational biology literature are special instances of such positive definite symmetric rational kernels [4]. This paper reviews the essential results given in [5, 3, 4] and presents them in the form of a short tutorial.\n",

In this paper we give an overview of discriminative methods developed for this problem. Special emphasis is put on large margin methods by generalizing multiclass Support Vector Machines and AdaBoost to the case of label sequences.

    "Boosting approaches are based on the idea that high-quality learning algorithms can be formed by repeated use of a \"weak-learner\", which is required to perform only slightly better than random guessing. It is known that Boosting can lead to drastic improvements compared to the individual weak-learner. For two-class problems it has been shown that the original Boosting algorithm, called AdaBoost, is quite unaffected by overfitting. However, for the case of noisy data, it is also understood that AdaBoost can be improved considerably by introducing some regularization technique. In speech-related problems one often considers multi-class problems and Boosting formulations have been used successfully to solve them. I review existing multi-class boosting algorithms, which have been much less analyzed and explored than the two-class pendants. In this work I extend these methods to derive new boosting algorithms which are more robust against outliers and noise in the data and are able to exploit prior knowledge about relationships between the classes.\n",

One well known set of multiplicative updates is given by the Expectation- Maximization algorithm for hidden Markov models, as used in automatic speech recognition. Recently, we have derived similar algorithms for nonnegative deconvolution and nonnegative quadratic programming. These algorithms have applications to low-level problems in voice processing, such as fundamental frequency estimation, as well as high-level problems, such as the training of large margin classifiers.

    "Most training algorithms for HMMs assume that the whole batch of observation sequences is given ahead of time. This is particularly the case for the standard EM algorithm. However, in many applications such as speech, the data is generated by a temporal process. Singer and Warmuth developed online updates for HMMs that process a single observation sequence in each update. In this paper we take this approach one step further and develop an inline update for training HMMs. Now the parameters are updated after processing a single symbol of the current observation sequence. The methodology for deriving the online and the new inline update is quite different from the standard EM motivation. We show experimentally on speech data that even when all observation sequences are available (batch mode), then the online update converges faster than the batch update, and the inline update converges even faster. The standard batch EM update exhibits the slowest convergence.\n",

We review the max approximation to log spectrograms of mixtures, show why this motivates a \"refiltering\" approach to separation and denoising, and then describe how the process of inference in factorial probabilistic models performs a computation useful for deriving the masking signals needed in refiltering. A particularly simple model, factorial-max vector quantization (MAXVQ), is introduced along with a branch-and-bound technique for efficient exact inference and applied to both denoising and monaural separation. Our approach represents a return to the ideas of Ephraim, Varga and Moore but applied to auditory scene analysis rather than to speech recognition.\n",

Requests may be spontaneous spoken and written utterances as well as mouse clicks; user actions may concern actual search, but also control of the browser. Because of spontaneous utterances, a large vocabulary and multimodal interaction, interpreting the user request and generating an appropriate system response is often difficult. Apart from a controller module, the system uses data from two corpora for compensating the difficulties associated with the scenario. Multimodal user actions, which were collected in Wizard-of-Oz experiments, serve as a base for the identification of patterns in users' spontaneous utterances. Furthermore, news documents are used for obtaining background knowledge which can contribute to query expansion whenever the interpretation of users' utterances encounters ambiguity or underspecification concerning the search terms.\n",

    "Although most known examples of cross-modal interactions in audio-visual speech perception involve a dominant visual signal that modifies the apparent audio signal heard by the observer, there may also be cases where an audio signal can alter the visual image seen by the observer. In this experiment, we examined the effects that different distracting audio signals had on an observer's ability to speechread a color and number combination from a visual speech stimulus. When the distracting signal was noise, time-reversed speech, or irrelevant continuous speech, speechreading performance was unaffected. However, when the distracting audio signal was speech that followed the same general syntax as the target speech but contained a different color and number combination, speechreading performance was dramatically reduced. This suggests that the amount of interference an audio signal causes in a speechreading task strongly depends on the semantic similarity of the target and masking phrases. The amount of interference did not, however, depend on the apparent similarity between the audio speech signal and the visible talker: masking phrases spoken by a talker who was different in sex than the visible talker interfered nearly as much with the speechreading task as masking phrases spoken by the same talker used in the visual stimulus. A second experiment that examined the effects of desynchronizing the audio and visual signals found that the amount of interference caused by the audio phrase decreased when it was time advanced or time delayed relative to the visual target, but that time shifts as large as 1 s were required before performance approached the level achieved with no audio signal. The results of these experiments are consistent with the existence of a kind of cross-modal \"informational masking\" that occurs when listeners who see one word and hear another are unable to correctly determine which word was present in the visual stimulus.\n",

A comparative study is achieved between different types of audio features, including the initial Line Spectral Pairs (LSP) and 4-subbands envelope energy. A gain measure of the enhancement is applied for the comparison. The results clearly show that the coarse envelope features allows a better gain than the LSP.\n",

Results indicate that in this context subjective task load was highest when manual/visual interaction was used. A solution may be interaction through user-determined modality selection, as results indicate that subjects judge their load lowest and performance and preference highest among the tested conditions when they are able to select the modality.

We report on experiments interpreting speech and laser scanner signals in the dialogue management system of the autonomous tour-guide robot RoboX, successfully deployed at the Swiss National Exhibition (Expo.02). A correct interpretation of a user's (visitor's) goal or intention at each dialogue state is a key issue for successful voice-enabled communication between tour-guide robots and visitors. To infer the visitors' goal under the uncertainty intrinsic to these two modalities, we introduce Bayesian networks for combining noisy speech recognition with data from a laser scanner, which is independent of acoustic noise. Experiments with real data, collected during the operation of RoboX at Expo.02 demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\n",

In the proposed method, the interframe correlation of LSFs is exploited using matrix quantization where N consecutive frames are quantized as one m-by-N matrix. The voicing-based multi-mode operation reduces the bit rate by taking advantage of the properties of the speech signal. That is, certain parts of a signal, such as unvoiced segments, can be quantized with smaller codebooks. With this method, very low variable bit rate LSF quantization is obtained. The proposed method is suitable especially for very low bit rate speech coders in which short time delay is tolerable, and high but not necessarily transparent quality is sufficient.\n",

The voicing controlled concealment outperforms the conventional extrapolation/muting based approach and it shows a consistent improvement over interpolation techniques that do not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced speech.

Furthermore, it has been confirmed through perceptual evaluation that the removal of these frequency components does not cause significant degradation of the speech quality but rather, it has consistently improved the output quality of two standardized speech codecs. Thus, the proposed irrelevancy removal technique can be used at the front end of a speech coder to achieve enhanced coding efficiency.\n",

This led to the speech alignment with its phonetic transcription and the use of polyphones, to finally increase output speech quality while keeping a bitrate between 400bits/s and 600bits/s. Typically, this can be used to store recorded alpha-numeric books for blind people, or compressing recorded courses for e-learning. Cell phone applications could also be considered.\n",

    "In this paper, an efficient transcoding algorithm between G.723.1 and AMR speech coders is proposed for providing interoperability between IP and mobile networks. Transcoding is completed through three processing steps: line spectral pair (LSP) conversion, pitch interval conversion, and fast adaptive-codebook search. For maintaining minimum distortion, sensitive parameters to quality such as adaptive and fixed-codebooks are re-estimated from synthesized target signals. To reduce overall complexity, other parameters are directly converted in parametric levels without running through the complete decoding process. Objective and subjective preference tests verify that the proposed transcoding algorithm has equivalent quality to conventional tandem approach. In addition, the proposed algorithm achieves 20~40% reduction of the overall complexity over tandem approach with a shorter processing delay.\n",

For switched prediction, a higher number of prediction matrices is proposed. Quality of the quantized speech is improved by the prediction multi-candidate and delayed decision algorithm. It is shown that quantizers with delayed decision can save up to one bit still having similar or even lower complexity than the baseline quantizers with 2 switched matrices. By efficient implementation of prediction, lower complexity can be achieved through use of prediction matrices with reduced number of non-zero elements. By combining such sparse matrices and multiple prediction candidates, the best quality-complexity compromise quantizers can be obtained as demonstrated by experimental results.\n",

    "In distributed classification applications, due to computational constraints, data acquired by low complexity clients is compressed and transmitted to a remote server for classification. In this paper the design of optimal quantization for distributed classification applications is considered and evaluated in the context of a speech recognition task. The proposed encoder minimizes the detrimental effect compression has on classification performance. Specifically, the proposed methods concentrate on designing low dimension encoders. Here individual encoders independently quantize sub-dimensions of a high dimension vector used for classification. The main novelty of the work is the introduction of mutual information as a metric for designing compression algorithms in classification applications. Given a rate constraint, the proposed algorithm minimizes the mutual information loss due to compression. Alternatively it ensures that the compressed data used for classification retains maximal information about the class labels. An iterative empirical algorithm (similar to the Lloyd algorithm) is provided to design quantizers for this new distortion measure. Additionally, mutual information is also used to propose a rate-allocation scheme where rates are allocated to the sub-dimensions of a vector (which are independently encoded) to satisfy a given rate constraint. The results obtained indicate that mutual information is a better metric (when compared to mean square error) for optimizing encoders used in distributed classification applications. In a distributed spoken names recognition task, the proposed mutual information based rate-allocation reduces by a factor of six the increase in WER due to compression when compared to a heuristic rate-allocation.\n",

The overall procedure utilizes a union of several lattices in order to enhance performance and to comply with source statistics. We provide experimental results in terms of SD for different conditions and compare these with high rate lower bounds.

Since there are trade-offs between lexicon size and lexical coverage, and between the length of lexical unit and WER, in our system we analyzed the training corpus to obtain a compact 24k-morpheme-based lexicon with 98.8% coverage. Then, the lexicon is optimized by combining morphemes using statistics of training corpus under monosyllable constraint or maximum length constraint. In experiments, our system reduced the number of monosyllable morphemes which are the most error-prone, from 52% to 29% of the lexicon and obtained 13.24% WER for anchor and 24.97% for reporter.\n",

    "The dominant acoustic modeling methodology based on Hidden Markov Models is known to have certain weaknesses. Partial solutions to these flaws have been presented, but the fundamental problem remains: compression of the data to a compact HMM discards useful information such as time dependencies and speaker information. In this paper, we look at pure example based recognition as a solution to this problem. By replacing the HMM with the underlying examples, all information in the training data is retained. We show how information about speaker and environment can be used, introducing a new interpretation of adaptation. The basis for the recognizer is the well-known DTW algorithm, which has often been used for small tasks. However, large vocabulary speech recognition introduces new demands, resulting in an explosion of the search space. We show how this problem can be tackled using a data driven approach which selects appropriate speech examples as candidates for DTW-alignment.\n",

The algorithms are proved to be very effective for workstation and embedded platform realizations. In order to decrease the processing power the word-stem based tree search with frame dropping approach is used. The recognition speed was increased by a factor of 5 without frame dropping and by a factor of 10 with frame dropping in comparison to linear Viterbi search for isolated word recognition task with a vocabulary of 20102 words. Thus, the large vocabulary isolated word recognition becomes possible for embedded systems.\n",

This paper addresses the specific issues related to HMM-based incremental phone classification with real-time constraints. The decoding algorithm described in this work enables a trade-off to be made between improved recognition accuracy and reduced latency. By accepting a longer latency per output increment, more time can be ascribed to hypothesis look-ahead and by that improve classification accuracy. Experiments performed on the Swedish SpeechDat database show that it is possible to generate the same classification as is produced by non-incremental decoding using HTK, by adopting a latency of approx. 150 ms or more.\n",

In contrast to the likelihood scores used by more traditional fast matching methods these posterior probabilities are more discriminative by nature as they sum up to unity over all the possible models.

Although we focus only on Turkish, the methods described here are general enough that they can be considered for other agglutinative languages like Finnish, Korean etc. In an agglutinative language, several words can be created from a single root word using a rich collection of morphological rules. So, a virtually infinite size lexicon is required to cover the language if words are used as the basic units. The standard approach to this problem is to discover a number of primitive units so that a large set of words can be created by compounding those units. Two broad classes of methods are available for splitting words into their sub-units; morphology-based and data-driven methods. Although the word splitting significantly reduces the out of vocabulary rate, it shrinks the context and increases acoustic confusibility. We have used two methods to address the latter. In one method, we use word counts to avoid splitting of high frequency lexical units, and in the other method, we recompound splits according to a probabilistic measure. We present experimental results that show the methods are very effective to lower the word error rate at the expense of lexicon size.\n",

    "Recent work has shown that the use of finite-state transducers (FST's) has many advantages in large vocabulary speech recognition. Most past work has focused on the use of triphone phonetic decision trees. However, numerous applications use decision trees that condition on wider contexts; for example, many systems at IBM use 11-phone phonetic decision trees. Alas, large-context phonetic decision trees cannot be compiled straightforwardly into FST's due to memory constraints. In this work, we discuss memory-efficient techniques for manipulating large-context phonetic decision trees in the FST framework. First, we describe a lazy expansion technique that is applicable when expanding small word graphs. For general applications, we discuss how to construct large-context transducers via a sequence of simple, efficient finite-state operations; we also introduce a memory-efficient implementation of determinization.\n",

    "Sphinx-4 is an open source HMM-based speech recognition system written in the Java^TM programming language. The design of the Sphinx-4 decoder incorporates several new features in response to current demands on HMM-based large vocabulary systems. Some new design aspects include graph construction for multilevel parallel decoding with multiple feature streams without the use of compound HMMs, the incorporation of a generalized search algorithm that subsumes Viterbi decoding as a special case, token stack decoding for efficient maintenance of multiple paths during search, design of a generalized language HMM graph from grammars and language models of multiple standard formats, that can potentially toggle between flat search structure, tree search structure, etc. This paper describes a few of these design aspects, and reports some preliminary performance measures for speed and accuracy.\n",

    "An important problem in large vocabulary speech recognition for agglutinative languages like Turkish is the high out of vocabulary (OOV) rate caused by extensive number of distinct words. Recognition systems using words as the basic lexical elements have difficulty in dealing with such virtually unlimited vocabulary. We propose a new time-synchronous lexical tree decoder design using morphemes as the lexical elements. A key feature of the proposed decoder is the dynamic generation of the lexical tree according to the morphological rules. The architecture emulates word generation in the language and therefore allows very large vocabularies through the defined set of morphemes and morphotactical rules.\n",

The goal is to allow these clients to control assistive technology by voice. While this is a small vocabulary, speaker-dependent, isolated-word application, the speech material is more variable than normal, and only a small amount of data is available for training. After training a CDHMM recogniser, it is necessary to predict its likely performance without using an independent test set, so that confusable words can be replaced by alternatives. We present a battery of measures of consistency and confusability, based on forced-alignment, which can be used to predict recogniser performance. We show how these measures perform, and how they are presented to the clinicians who are the users of the system.\n",

    "Recent improvements in computer systems are increasing the amount of accessible speech data. Since speech media is not appropriate for quick scanning, the development of automatic summarization of lecture or meeting speech is expected. Spoken messages contain non-linguistic information, which is mainly expressed by prosody, while written text conveys only linguistic information. There are possibilities that the prosodic information can improve the quality of speech summarization. This paper describes a technique of using prosodic parameters as well as linguistic information to identify important sentences for speech summarization. Several prosodic parameters about F0, power and duration are extracted for each sentence in lecture speech. Importance of the sentence is predicted by the prosodic parameters and the linguistic information. We also tried to combine the prosodic parameters and the linguistic information by multiple regression analysis. Proposed methods are evaluated both on the correlation between the predicted scores of sentence importance and the preference scores by subjects and on the accuracy of extraction of important sentences. By combination of the prosodic parameters improves the quality of speech summarization.\n",

    "This paper describes a speech-input interface function, called speech shift, that enables a user to specify a speech-input mode by simply changing (shifting) voice pitch. While current speech-input interfaces have used only verbal information, we aimed at building a more user-friendly speech interface by making use of nonverbal information, the voice pitch. By intentionally controlling the pitch, a user can enter the same word with it having different meanings (functions) without explicitly changing the speech-input mode. Our speech-shift function implemented on a voice-enabled word processor, for example, can distinguish an utterance with a high pitch from one with a normal (low) pitch, and regard the former as voice-command-mode input (such as file-menu and edit-menu commands) and the latter as regular dictation-mode text input. Our experimental results from twenty subjects showed that the speech-shift function is effective, easy to use, and a labor-saving input method.\n",

    "SALT is an industrial standard that enables speech input/ output for Web applications. Although the core design is to make simple tasks easy, SALT gives the designers ample fine-grained controls to create advanced user interface. The paper exploits a speech input mode in which SALT would dynamically report partial semantic parses while audio capturing is still ongoing. The semantic parses can be evaluated and the outcome reported immediately back to the user. The potential impact for the dialog systems is that tasks conventionally performed in a system turn can now be carried out in the midst of a user turn, thereby presenting a significant departure from the conventional turn-taking. To assess the efficacy of such highly interactive interface, more user studies are undoubtedly needed. This paper demonstrates how SALT can be employed to facilitate such studies.\n",

Recognition is carried out with a 5k syllable language model and a 10k mixed-unit language model whose vocabulary consists of a mixture of words and syllables. Both language models make retrieval performance possible that is comparable to that attained when a large vocabulary word-based language model is used. Experiments are performed on a spoken document collection consisting of short German-language radio documentaries. First, the vector space model is applied to a known item retrieval task and a similar-document search.

    "Spontaneously spoken utterances are characterized by a number of lexical and non-lexical features. These features can also reflect speaker specific characteristics. A major factor that discriminates spontaneous speech from written text is the presence of these paralinguistic features such as filled pauses (fillers), false starts, laughter, disfluencies and discourse markers that are beyond the framework of formal grammars. The speech recognition community has dealt with these variabilities by making provisions for them in language models, to improve recognition accuracy for spoken language. In another scenario, the analysis of these features could also be used for language processing/generation for the overall improvement of synthesized speech or machine response. Such synthesized spontaneous speech could be used for computer avatars and Speech User Interfaces (SUIs) where lengthy interactions with machines occur, and it is generally desired to mimic a particular speaker or the speaking style. This problem of language generation involves capturing general characteristics of spontaneous speech and also speaker specific traits. The usefulness of conventional language processing tools is limited by the availability of training corpus. Hence and empirical text processing technique with ideas motivated from psycholinguistics is proposed. Such an empirical technique could be included in the text analysis stage of a TTS system. The proposed technique is adaptable: it can be extended to mimic different speakers based on an individual's speaking style and filler preferences.\n",

In this paper we present our recent work on name recognition with User Modeling (UM), i.e., automatic modeling of user's behavior patterns.

When current speech recognizers are used in a noisy environment, a typical recognition error is caused by incorrect endpoints because their automatic detection is likely to be disturbed by non-stationary noises. The speech starter function enables a user to specify the beginning of each utterance by uttering a filler with a filled pause, which is used as a trigger to start speech-recognition processes. Since filled pauses can be detected robustly in a noisy environment, practical endpoint detection is achieved. Speech starter also offers the advantage of providing a hands-free speech interface and it is user-friendly because a speaker tends to utter filled pauses (e.g., \"er...\") at the beginning of utterances when hesitating in human-human communication. Experimental results from a 10-dB-SNR noisy environment show that the recognition error rate with speech starter was lower than with conventional endpoint-detection methods.\n",

    "In film post-production, efficient methods for re-recording a dialogue or dubbing in a new language require a precisely time-aligned text, with individual letters time-coded to video frame resolution. Currently, this time alignment is performed by experts in a painstaking and slow process.\n",
    "To automate this process, we used CRIM's large vocabulary HMM speech recognizer as a phoneme segmenter and measured its accuracy on typical film extracts in French and English. Our results reveal several characteristics of film dialogues, in addition to noise, that affect segmentation accuracy, such as speaking style or reverberant recordings. Despite these difficulties, an HMM-based segmenter trained on clean speech can still provide more than 89% acceptable phoneme boundaries on typical film extracts. We also propose a method which provides the correspondence between aligned phonemes and graphemes of the text. The method does not use explicit rules, but rather computes an optimal string alignment according to an edit-distance metric.\n",
    "Together, HMM phoneme segmentation and phoneme-grapheme correspondence meet the needs of film postproduction for a time-aligned text, and make it possible to automate a large part of the current post-synch process.\n",

We have applied these techniques to the business listings of a state in the Midwestern United States, and we present highly encouraging recognition results.\n",

This paper describes several recent enhancements in CU VOCAL. First, we have augmented the syllable unit selection strategy with a positional feature. This feature specifies the relative location of a syllable in a sentence and serves to improve the quality of Cantonese tone realization. Second, we have developed the CU VOCAL SAPI engine, a version of the synthesizer that eases integration with applications using SAPI (Speech Application Programming Interface). We demonstrate the use of CU VOCAL SAPI in an electronic book (e-book) reader. Third, we have made an initial attempt to use the CU VOCAL SAPI engine in Web content authored with Speech Application Language Tags (SALT). The use of SALT tags can ease the task of invoking Cantonese TTS service on webpages.\n",

Each component of the main processing block of our system was evaluated separately, using the ALERT corpus. Likewise, the user interface was also evaluated separately. Besides this modular evaluation which will be briefly mentioned here, as a reference, the system can also be evaluated as a whole, in a field trial from the point of view of a potential user. This is the main topic of this paper. The analysis of the main sources of problems hinted at a large number of issues that must be dealt with in order to improve the performance. In spite of these pending problems, we believe that having a fully operational system is a must for being able to address user needs in the future in this type of service.\n",

In this paper, we propose a joint excitation parameter optimization framework in which the associated complexity is slightly greater than the traditional sequential optimization, but with significant quality improvement. Moreover, the framework allows joint optimization to be easily incorporated into existing pulse codebook systems with little or no impact to the codebook search algorithms.\n",

Our concern in this paper is the situation in which there is no speech or phoneme recognizer available for the domain of the speech data. In this situation the only inputs for training the system are audio speech files labeled according to the topics of interest. The process that we follow in developing the topic classifier is that of data segmentation followed by the representation of the segments by polynomial trajectory models. The clustering of acoustically similar segments enables us to train a trajectory Gaussian mixture model that is used to label segments of both on topic and off topic data and the labeled data enables us to create topic classifiers. The advantage of the approach that we are pursuing is that it is language and domain independent. We evaluated the performance of our approach with several classifiers demonstrated positive results.\n",

    "Speech recognition accuracy degrades significantly when the speech has been corrupted by noise, especially when the system has been trained on clean speech. Many compensation algorithms have been developed which require reliable online noise estimates or a priori knowledge of the noise. In situations where such estimates or knowledge is difficult to obtain, these methods fail. We present a new robustness algorithm which avoids these problems by making no assumptions about the corrupting noise. Instead, we exploit properties inherent to the speech signal itself to denoise the recognition features. In this method, speech is decomposed into harmonic and noise-like components, which are then processed independently and recombined. By processing noise-corrupted speech in this manner we achieve significant improvements in recognition accuracy on the Aurora 2 task.\n",

    "The problem of reliable speech recognition for in-vehicle applications has recently emerged as a challenging research domain. This study focuses on the feature extraction stage of this problem. The approach is based on MinimumVariance Distortionless Response (MVDR) spectrum estimation. MVDR is used for robustly estimating the envelope of the speech signal and shown to be very accurate and relatively less sensitive to additive noise. The proposed feature estimation process removes the traditional Mel-scaled filterbank as a perceptually motivated frequency partitioning. Instead, we directly warp the FFT power spectrum of speech. The word error rate (WER) is shown to decrease by 27.3% with respect to the MFCCs and 18.8% with respect to recently proposed PMCCs on an extended digit recognition task in real car environments. The proposed feature estimation approach is called PMVDR and conclusively shown to be a better speech representation in real environments with emphasis on time-varying car noise.\n",

    "Double-talk recognition under a distant microphone condition, a serious problem in speech applications in a real environment, is realized through use of modified SAFIA and acoustic model adaptation or training. The original SAFIA is a high-performance audio segregation method based on band selection using two directivity microphones. We have modified SAFIA by adopting array signal processing and have realized optimal directivity for SAFIA. We also used generalized harmonic analysis (GHA) instead of FFT for the spectral analysis in SAFIA to remove the effect of windowing which causes sound-quality degradation in SAFIA.\n",
    "These modifications of SAFIA enable good segregation in a human auditory sense, but the quality is still insufficient for recognition. Because SAFIA causes some particular distortion, we used MLLR-based acoustic model adaptation and immunity training to be robust to the distortion of SAFIA. These efforts enabled 76.2% word accuracy under the condition that the SN ratio is 0 dB, this represents a 45% reduction in the error obtained in the case where only array signal processing was used, and a 30% error reduction compared with when only SAFIA-based audio segregation was used.\n",

    "Among a number of studies which have investigated various speech enhancement and processing schemes for in-vehicle speech systems, the delay-and-sum beamforming (DASB) and adaptive beamforming are two typical methods that both have their advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a novel combined fixed/adaptive beamforming solution (CFABF) based on previous work for speech enhancement and recognition in real moving car environments, which seeks to take advantage of both methods. The working scheme of CFABF consists of two steps: source location calibration and target signal enhancement. The first step is to pre-record the transfer functions between speaker and microphone array from different potential source positions using adaptive beamforming under quiet environments; and the second step is to use this pre-recorded information to enhance the desired speech when the car is running on the road. An evaluation using extensive actual car speech data from the CU-Move Corpus shows that the method can decrease WER for speech recognition by up to 30% over a single channel scenario.\n",

The performance of all components of a state-of-the-art audio-visual ASR system is reported on these two sets and benchmarked against \"visually clean\" data recorded in a studio-like environment. Not surprisingly, both audio- and visual-only ASR degrade, more than doubling their respective word error rates. Nevertheless, visual speech remains beneficial to ASR.\n",

    "The SYNFACE project has as its primary goal to facilitate for hearing-impaired people to use an ordinary telephone. This will be achieved by using a talking face connected to the telephone. The incoming speech signal will govern the speech movements of the talking face, hence the talking face will provide lip-reading support for the user.  The project will define the visual speech information that supports lip-reading, and develop techniques to derive this information from the acoustic speech signal in near real time for three different languages: Dutch, English and Swedish. This requires the development of automatic speech recognition methods that detect information in the acoustic signal that correlates with the speech movements. This information will govern the speech movements in a synthetic face and synchronise them with the acoustic speech signal. A prototype system is being constructed. The prototype contains results achieved so far in SYNFACE. This system will be tested and evaluated for the three languages by hearing-impaired users. SYNFACE is an IST project (IST-2001-33327) with partners from the Netherlands, UK and Sweden. SYNFACE builds on experiences gained in the Swedish Teleface project.\n",

The Web browser was built from the GTK Web browser Dillo, which is a free software project in terms of the GNU general public license. Additional functionality has been introduced to this original browser in form of different modules. The browser operates in two different modes, browsing mode and dialogue mode. In browsing mode user navigates through structure of Web pages using mouse and/or keyboard. When in dialogue mode, the dialogue module offers different actions and the user chooses between them using either keyboard or spoken-commands which are recognized by the speech-recognition module. The content of the page is presented to the user by screen-reader module which uses text-to-speech module for its output. The browser is capable of displaying all common Web pages that do not contain frames, java or flash animations. However, the best performance is achieved when pages comply with the recommendations set by the WAI. The browser has been developed in Linux operating system and later ported to Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP platform. Currently it is being tested by members of the Slovenian blind people society. Any suggestions or wishes from them will be considered for inclusion in future versions of the browser.\n",

    "In this paper we show how to exploit raw speech data to gain higher level information about the user in a mobile context. In particular we introduce an approach for the estimation of age and gender using well known machine learning techniques. On the basis of this information, systems like for example a mobile pedestrian navigation system, can be made adaptive to the special needs of a specific user group (here the elderly). First we provide a motivation why we consider such an adaptation as necessary, then we outline some adaptation strategies that are adequate for mobile assistants. The major part of the paper is about (a) identifying and extracting features of speech that are relevant for age and gender estimation and (b) classifying a particular speaker, treating uncertainty, and updating the user model over time. Finally we provide a short outlook on current work.\n",

    "Formal evaluations conducted by NIST in 1996 demonstrated that systems that used parallel banks of tokenizer-dependent language models produced the best language identification performance. Since that time, other approaches to language identification have been developed that match or surpass the performance of phone-based systems. This paper describes and evaluates three techniques that have been applied to the language identification problem: phone recognition, Gaussian mixture modeling, and support vector machine classification. A recognizer that fuses the scores of three systems that employ these techniques produces a 2.7% equal error rate (EER) on the 1996 NIST evaluation set and a 2.8% EER on the NIST 2003 primary condition evaluation set. An approach to dealing with the problem of out-of-set data is also discussed.\n",

    "This paper describes a proposed automatic language accent identification system based on phoneme class trajectory models. Our focus is to preserve discriminant information of the spectral evolution that belong to each accent. Here, we describe two classification schemes based on stochastic trajectory models; supervised and unsupervised classification. For supervised classification, we assume text of spoken words are known and integrate this into the classification scheme. Unsupervised classification uses a Multi-Trajectory Template, which represents the global temporal evolution of each accent. No prior text knowledge of the input speech is required for the unsupervised scheme. We also conduct human-perceptual accent classification experiments for comparison automatic system performance. The experiments are conducted on 3 foreign accents (Chinese, Thai, and Turkish) with native American English. Our experimental evaluation shows that supervised classification outperforms unsupervised classification by 11.5%. In general, supervised classification performance increases to 80% correct accent discrimination as we increase the phoneme sequence to 11 accent-sensitive phonemes.\n",

    "Recently, we have proposed a parallel sub-word recognition (PSWR) system for language identification (LID) in a framework similar to the parallel phone recognition (PPR) approach in the literature, but without requiring phonetic labeling of the speech data in any of the languages in the LID task. In this paper, we show the theoretical equivalence of PSWR and ergodic- HMM (E-HMM) based LID. Here, the front-end sub-word recognizer (SWR) and back-end language model (LM) of each language in PSWR correspond to the states and state-transitions of the E-HMM in that language. This equivalence unifies the parallel phone (sub-word) recognition and ergodic-HMM approaches, which have been treated as two distinct frameworks in the LID literature so far, thus providing further insights into both these frameworks. On a 6-language LID task using the OGI-TS database, the E-HMM system achieves performances comparable to the PSWR system, offering clear experimental validation of their equivalence.\n",

    "This paper investigates an approach that maximizes the joint posterior probability of the pronounced word and the speaker identity given the observed data. This probability can be expressed as a product of the posterior probability of the pronounced word estimated through an artificial neural network (ANN), and the likelihood of the data estimated through a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We show that the posterior probabilities estimated through a speaker-dependent ANN, as usually done in the hybrid HMM/ANN systems, are reliable for speech recognition but they are less reliable for speaker recognition. To alleviate this problem, we thus study how this posterior probability can be combined with the likelihood derived from a speaker-dependent GMM model to improve the speaker recognition performance. We thus end up with a joint model that can be used for text-dependent speaker identification and for speech recognition (and mutually benefiting from each other).\n",

In this paper we report on the effectiveness of using polyphone decision tree specialization method for non-native speech adaptation and recognition. Several recognition results are presented by using non-native speech from German speakers. Results obtained from the experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this method.\n",

The amount of additional computation when PCA or ICA is applied is as small as it can be disregarded. The dimension of HMM parameters is reduced to about 1/3~2/7 dimensions of SI (speaker independent) model parameter with which speech recognition system represents word recognition rate as much as ordinary MLLR framework. If dimension of SI model parameter is n , the amount of computation of inverse matrix in MLLR is proportioned to O(n^4).

    "This paper presents a geometric constrained transformation approach for fast acoustic adaptation, which improves the modeling resolution of the conventional Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR). For this approach, the underlying geometry difference between the seed and the target spaces is exposed and quantified, and used as a prior knowledge to reconstruct refiner transforms. Ignoring dimensions that have minor affections to this difference, the transform could be constrained to a lower rank subspace. And only distortions within this subspace are to be refined in a cascaded process. Compared to previous cascade method, we employ a different parameterization and obtain a higher resolution. At the same time, since the geometric span for refiner transforms is highly controlled, it could be adapted quickly. So, it could achieve a better tradeoff between resolution and robustness. In Mandarin dialect adaptations, this approach provides 4~9% word-error-rate relative decrease over MLLR and 3~5% over previous cascade method correspondingly with varying amounts of data.\n",

    "In support of speech-driven question answering, we propose a method to construct N-gram language models for recognizing spoken questions with high accuracy. Question-answering systems receive queries that often consist of two parts: one conveys the query topic and the other is a fixed phrase used in query sentences. A language model constructed by using a target collection of QA, for example, newspaper articles, can model the former part, but cannot model the latter part appropriately. We tackle this problem as task adaptation from language models obtained from background corpora (e.g., newspaper articles) to the fixed phrases, and propose a method that does not use the task-specific corpus, which is often difficult to obtain, but instead uses only manually listed fixed phrases. The method emphasizes a subset of N-grams obtained from a background corpus that corresponds to fixed phrases specified by the list. Theoretically, this method can be regarded as maximizing a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation using the subset of the N-grams as a posteriori distribution. Some experiments show the effectiveness of our method.\n",

    "Pronunciation variations can be roughly classified into two types: a phone change or a sound change [1][2]. A phone change happens when a canonical phone is produced as a different phone. Such a change can be modeled by converting the baseform (standard) phone to a surfaceform (actual) phone. A sound change happens at a lower, phonetic or subphonetic level within a phone and it cannot be modeled well by either the baseform or the surfaceform phone alone. We propose here to refine the acoustic models to cope with sound changes by (1) sharing the Gaussian mixture components of HMM states in the baseform and the surfaceform models; (2) adapting the mixture components of the baseform models towards those of the surfaceform models; (3) selectively reconstructing new acoustic models through sharing or adapting. The proposed pronunciation modeling algorithms are generic and can, in principle, be applied to different languages. Specifically, they were tested in a Cantonese speech recognition database. Relative word error rate reductions of 5.45%, 2.53%, and 3.04% have been achieved using the three approaches, respectively.\n",

    "Language model (LM) adaptation is a necessary step when the LM is applied to speech recognition. The task of LM adaptation is to use out-domain data to improve in-domain model's performance since the available in-domain (task-specific) data set is usually not large enough for LM training. LM adaptation faces two problems. One is the poor quality of the out-domain training data. The other is the mismatch between the n-gram distribution in out-domain data set and that in in-domain data set. This paper presents two methods, filtering and distribution adaptation, to solve them respectively. First, a bootstrapping method is presented to filter suitable portion from two large variable quality out-domain data sets for our task. Then a new algorithm is proposed to adjust the n-gram distribution of the two data sets to that of a task-specific but small data set. We consider preventing over-fitting problem in adaptation. All resulting models are evaluated on the realistic application of email dictation. Experiments show that each method achieves better performance, and the combined method achieves a perplexity reduction of 24% to 80%.\n",

    "Current research in the area of foreign-accented speech recognition focusses either on acoustic model adaptation or speaker-dependent pronunciation variation modeling. In this paper both approaches are applied in parallel and in a speaker-independent fashion: the acoustic modeling part is based on a derived Hidden Markov Model (HMM) clustering algorithm and the lexicon adaptation is based on speaker-independent multiple pronunciation rules. The pronunciation rules are derived using phoneme-level pronunciation scores. Foreign-accented speech was simulated with Columbian Spanish and Spanish of Spain and the experiments showed an improved recognition performance for the acoustic modeling part and identical recognition results when adding pronunciation variants to the lexica. Both results are taken as indicators for an improved recognition performance when applied on real foreign-accented speech. The present limited availability of foreign-accented speech databases, however, clearly merits further investigations.\n",

    "Noise and speaker adaptation techniques are essential to realize robust speech recognition in noisy environments. In this paper, first, a noise robust speech recognition algorithm is implemented by superimposing a small quantity of noise data on spectral subtracted input speech. According to the recognition experiments, 30dB SNR noise superimposition on input speech after spectral subtraction increases the robustness against different noises significantly. Next, we apply this noise robust speech recognition to the unsupervised speaker adaptation algorithm based on HMM sufficient statistics in different noise environments. The HMM sufficient statistics for each speaker are calculated from 25dB SNR office noise added speech database beforehand. We evaluate successfully our proposed unsupervised speaker adaptation algorithm in noisy environments with 20k dictation task using 11 kinds of different noises, including office, car, exhibition, and crowd noises.\n",

    "This paper proposes two new approaches to rapid speaker adaptation of acoustic models by using genetic algorithms. Whereas conventional speaker adaptation techniques yield adapted models which represent local optimum solutions, genetic algorithms are capable to provide multiple optimal solutions, thereby delivering potentially more robust adapted models. We have investigated two different strategies of application of the genetic algorithm in the framework of speaker adaptation of acoustic models. The first approach ( GA) consists in using a genetic algorithm to adapt the set of Gaussian means to a new speaker. The second approach ( GA + EV) uses the genetic algorithm to enrich the set of speaker-dependant systems employed by the EigenVoices. Experiments with the Resource Management corpus show that, with one adaptation utterance, GA can improve the performances of a speaker-independent system as efficiently as EigenVoices. The method GA + EV outperforms EigenVoices.\n",

These experiments looked at the impact of foreign accent on speech recognition, both within non-native accented English and across different accents, with particular interest in using context free grammar technology to improve callsign identification. Results show that phonetic models built from foreign accented English are not less accurate than native ones at decoding novel data with the same accent. Cross accent recognition experiments show that phonetic models from a given accent group were 1.8 times less accurate in recognizing speech from a different accent. In contrast to other attempts to perform accurate recognition across accents, our approach of training very compact, accent-specific models (less than 3 hours of speech) provided very accurate results without the arduous task of adapting a phonetic dictionary to every accent.\n",

    "When phone segmentations are known a priori, normalizing the duration of each phone has been shown to be effective in overcoming weaknesses in duration modeling of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). While we have observed potential relative reductions in word error rate (WER) of up to 34.6% with oracle segmentation information, it has been difficult to achieve significant improvement in WER with segmentation boundaries that are estimated blindly. In this paper, we present simple variants of our duration normalization algorithm, which make use of blindly-estimated segmentation boundaries to produce different recognition hypotheses for a given utterance. These hypotheses can then be combined for significant improvements in WER. With oracle segmentations, WER reductions of up to 38.5% are possible. With automatically derived segmentations, this approach has achieved a reduction of WER of 3.9% for the Broadcast News corpus, 6.2% for the spontaneous register of the MULT_REG corpus, and 7.7% for a spontaneous corpus of connected Spanish digits collected by Telefonica Investigacion y Desarrollo.\n",

Effects of the proposed prior distribution in MAPLR based variance adaptation are characterized and compared with conventional maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) based variance adaptation. These findings provide a consistent Bayesian theoretical framework to incorporate prior knowledge in linear regression based variance adaptation.

Optimal mean vector and covariance matrix of the centroid normal distribution are derived and a set of Riccati matrix equations is used to find the optimal covariance matrix. The solutions are found iteratively by alternating the intermediate mean and covariance solutions. Clustering performance of the new algorithm is shown to be superior to that of non-optimal sample mean and covariance solutions. It achieves a lower overall distortion and flatter distributions of pdf samples across clusters. The resultant optimal clusters were further tested on the Wall Street Journal database for adapting HMM parameters in a Structured Maximum A Posterior Linear Regression (SMAPLR) framework. The recognition performance was significantly improved and the word error rate was reduced from 32.6% for a non-optimal centroid (sample mean and covariance) to 27.6% and 27.5% for the diagonal and full covariance matrix cases, respectively.\n",

    "Adaptation to a new speaker or environment is becoming very important as speech recognition systems are deployed in unpredictable real world situations. Constrained or Feature space Maximum Likelihood Regression (fMLLR) [1] has proved to be especially effective for this purpose, particularly when used for incremental unsupervised adaptation [2]. Unfortunately the standard implementation described in [1] and used by most authors since, requires statistics that require O(n^3) operations to collect per frame. In addition the statistics require O(n^3) space for storage and the estimation of the feature transform matrix requires O(n^4) operations. This is an unacceptable cost for most embedded speech recognition systems. In this paper we show the fMLLR objective function can be optimized using stochastic gradient descent in a way that achieves almost the same results as the standard implementation. All this is accomplished with an algorithm that requires only O(n^2) operations per frame and O(n^2) storage requirements. This order of magnitude savings allows continuous adaptation to be implemented in most resource constrained embedded speech recognition applications.\n",

    "This paper applies the recently proposed SPAM models for acoustic modeling in a Speaker Adaptive Training (SAT) context on large vocabulary conversational speech databases, including the Switchboard database. SPAM models are Gaussian mixture models in which a subspace constraint is placed on the precision and mean matrices (although this paper focuses on the case of unconstrained means). They include diagonal covariance, full covariance, MLLT, and EMLLT models as special cases. Adaptation is carried out with maximum likelihood estimation of the means and feature-space under the SPAM model. This paper shows the first experimental evidence that the SPAM models can achieve significant word-error-rate improvements over state-of-the-art diagonal covariance models, even when those diagonal models are given the benefit of choosing the optimal number of Gaussians (according to the Bayesian Information Criterion). This paper also is the first to apply SPAM models in a SAT context. All experiments are performed on the IBM \"Superhuman\" speech corpus which is a challenging and diverse conversational speech test set that includes the Switchboard portion of the 1998 Hub5e evaluation data set.\n",

Regardless of the distribution of the adaptation data, traditional model adaptation methods incorporate the adaptation data undiscriminatingly. When the data size is small and the parameter tying is extensive, adaptation based on outliers can be detrimental. A way to discriminate the contribution of each data in the adaptation is to incorporate a confidence measure based on likelihood. We evaluate and compare the performances of the proposed weighted SMAP (WSMAP) which controls the contribution of each data by sigmoid weighting using a novel confidence measure.

Several improvements for the JA have been proposed in the last years, either to generalize the Jacobian linear transformation for the case of large noise mismatch between training and testing or to extend the adaptation to other degrading factors, like channel distortion and vocal tract length. However, the JA technique has only been used so far with the conventional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). In this paper, the JA technique is applied to an alternative type of features, the Frequency-Filtered (FF) spectral energies, resulting in a more computationally efficient approach. Furthermore, in experimental tests with the database Aurora1, this new approach has shown an improved recognition performance with respect to the Jacobian adaptation with MFCCs.\n",

    "Within the framework of speaker-adaptation, a technique based on tree structure and the maximum a posteriori criterion was proposed (SMAP). In SMAP, the parameters estimation, at each node in the tree is based on the assumption that the mismatch between the training and adaptation data is a Gaussian PDF which parameters are estimated by using the Maximum Likelihood criterion. To avoid poor transformation parameters estimation accuracy due to an insufficiency of adaptation data in a node, we propose a new technique based on the maximum a posteriori approach and PDF Gaussians Merging. The basic idea behind this new technique is to estimate an affine transformations which bring the training acoustic models as close as possible to the test acoustic models rather than transformation maximizing the likelihood of the adaptation data. In this manner, even with very small amount of adaptation data, the parameters transformations are accurately estimated for means and variances. This adaptation strategy has shown a significant performance improvement in a large vocabulary speech recognition task, alone and combined with the MLLR adaptation.\n",

This algorithm departs from the generalized probability descent (GPD) algorithm, and it is well suited for model adaptation with a small amount of training data. The proposed approach is applied to linear regression based variance adaptation, and the close form solution for variance adaptation using MCE linear regression (MCELR) is derived.

Large lexica consisting of phonetic, prosodic and morpho-syntactic content will be provided with well-documented specifications for at least 12 languages [1]. This paper provides a short overview of the speech-to-speech translation lexica in general as well as a summary of the LC-STAR project itself. More detailed information about the specification for the corpora collection and word extraction as well as the specification and format of the lexica are presented in later chapters.\n",

    "This paper describes the implementation of a full-scale pronunciation lexicon for Turkish based on a two-level morphological analyzer. The system produces at its output, a parallel representation of the pronunciation and the morphological analysis of the word form so that morphological disambiguation can be used to disambiguate pronunciation when necessary. The pronunciation representation is based on the SAMPA standard and also encodes the position of the primary stress. The computation of the position of the primary stress depends on an interplay of any exceptional stress in root words and stress properties of certain morphemes, and requires that a full morphological analysis be done. The system has been implemented using XRCE Finite State Toolkit.\n",

Based on hidden Markov models (HMM), an initial estimation of segmentation from the explicit phonetic transcription are processed by our local HMM training algorithm. With reliable silence boundaries obtained by a silence detector, this algorithm tries different training methods to overcome the insufficient training data problem. The performance is tested in a Mandarin TTS speech corpus. The results show that using this method, a 14.98% improvement is achieved in the boundary detection error rate (deviating larger than 20 ms).\n",

    "In fundamental linguistic as well as in speech technology research there is an increasing need for procedures to automatically generate and validate phonetic transcriptions. Whereas much research has already focussed on the automatic generation of phonetic transcriptions, far less attention has been paid to the validation of such transcriptions. In the little research performed in this area, the estimation of the quality of (automatically generated) phonetic transcriptions is typically based on the comparison between these transcriptions and a human-made reference transcription. We believe, however, that the quality of phonetic transcriptions should ideally be estimated with the application in which the transcriptions will be used in mind, provided that the application is known at validation time. The application focussed on in this paper is automatic speech recognition, the validation criterion is the word error rate. We achieved a higher accuracy with a recogniser trained on an automatically generated transcription than with a similar recogniser trained on a human-made transcription resembling a human-made reference transcription more. This indicates that the traditional validation approach may not always be the most optimal one.\n",

    "Speech control is still mainly evaluated through statistical performance measures (recognition rate, insertion rate, etc.) considering the performance of a speech recognizer under laboratory or artificial noise conditions. All these measures give no idea about the practical usability of a speech interface, since practical aspects concern more than operational aspects of the speech recognizer inside a product. Since it was felt, that no evaluation standard so far fulfills the practical requirements for speech controlled products, this paper aims in the establishment of an open design- and evaluation standard for speech control concepts in real-world scenarios. First, the behaviour of the users and the normal environmental conditions (typical noises) were evaluated in usability experiments. Data recordings were conducted, trying to capture these typical usage requirements in a special corpus (Apollo-corpus). Finally, a set of standard desktop-, as well as embedded speech recognizers were tested for their performance under these real world conditions.\n",

The LIUM-AVS database comprises two parts: (*) series PBS Phonetically Balanced Sentences in French (*) series LET Spelled letters (also in French) These two parts contain sequences with both natural and blue lips. The whole database is released mainly to test and compare lip segmentation approaches on natural images, but speech recognition experiments may also be carried using this corpus.

    "In this paper, a diphone based Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for the Turkish language is presented. Turkish is the official language of Turkey, where it is the native language of 70 million people and it is also widely spoken in Asia (Azerbaidjain, Uzbekhstan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizhstan and Iran), Cyprus and the Balkans. The research has been done through a visiting internship at CSLR (the Center for Spoken Language Research, University of Colorado at Boulder) as part of an ongoing collaboration between CSLR and METU (Middle East Technical University), Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The system is based on Festival Speech Synthesis System. A diphone database has been designed for Turkish. Tools developed for quick diphone collection and segmentation are illustrated. The text analysis module, the methods used for determination of segment durations and pitch contours are discussed in detail. A Diagnostic Rhyme Test (DRT) has been designed for Turkish to test the intelligibility of the output speech. The resulting TTS system is found to be 86.5% intelligible on the average by 20 listeners. This is the first diphone based Turkish TTS system, whose intelligibility is reported. We also believe that, this paper would help researchers working on building TTS voices, especially those who work on agglutinative languages, since every step needed along the way are explained in detail.\n",

We trace the evolution of the Switchboard protocol including recent adaptations that have allowed for very cost-efficient data collection.

Finally, we introduce the new \"Fisher\" protocol comparing its design and yield to the other protocols. We conclude with a summary of data resources that result from each of the protocols described herein and that are generally available.\n",

    "A new database project has been launched in Estonia last year. It aims the collection of telephone speech from a large number of speakers for speech and speaker recognition purposes. Up to 2000 speakers are expected to participate in recordings. SpeechDat databases, especially Finnish SpeechDat, have been chosen as a prototype for the Estonian database. It means that principles of corpus design, file formats, recording and labelling methods implemented by the SpeechDat consortium will be followed as closely as possible.

    "Considerable effort has been devoted at L^2F to increase and broaden our speech and text data resources. Digital Talking Books ( DTB), comprising both speech and text data are, as such, an invaluable asset as multimedia resources. Furthermore, those DTB have been under a speech-to-text alignment procedure, either word or phone-based, to increase their potential in research activities. This paper thus describes the motivation and the method that we used to accomplish this goal for aligning DTBs. This alignment allows specific access interfaces for persons with special needs, and also tools for easily detecting and indexing units (words, sentences, topics) in the spoken books. The alignment tool was implemented in a Weighted Finite State Transducer framework, which provides an efficient way to combine different types of knowledge sources, such as alternative pronunciation rules. With this tool, a 2-hour long spoken book was aligned in a single step in much less than real time. Last but not least, new browsing interfaces, allowing improved access and data retrieval to and from the DTBs, are described in this paper.\n",

Under the DARPA EARS program, technology providers are charged with creating STT systems whose outputs are substantially richer and much more accurate than is currently possible. These aggressive program goals motivate new approaches to corpus creation and distribution. EARS participants require multilingual broadcast and telephone speech data, transcripts and annotations at a much higher volume than for any previous program. While standard approaches to resource collection and creation are prohibitively expensive for this volume of material, within EARS new methods have been established to allow for the development of vast quantities of audio, transcripts and annotations. New distribution methods also provide for efficient deployment of needed resources to participating research sites as well as enabling eventual publication to a wider community of language researchers.\n",

    "Intonation is often considered to play an important role in the vocal communication of emotion. Early studies using pitch manipulation have supported this view. However, the properties of pitch contours involved in marking emotional state remain largely unidentified. In this contribution, a corpus of actor-generated utterances for 8 emotions was used to measure intonation (pitch contour) by identifying key features of the F0 contour. The data show that the profiles obtained vary reliably with respect to F0 level as a function of the degree of activation of the emotion concerned. However, there is little evidence for qualitatively different forms of profiles for different emotions. Results of recent collaborative studies on the use of the F0 patterns identified in this research with synthesized utterances are presented. The nature of the contribution of F0/pitch contours to emotional speech is discussed; it is argued that pitch contours have to be considered as configurations that acquire emotional meaning only through interaction with a linguistic and paralinguistic context.\n",

Low-level tags tend to change their values frequently, even within a word, while the more abstract tags generally apply to whole words, sentences or paragraphs.

    "Unit Selection Synthesis, where appropriate units are selected from large databases of natural speech, has greatly improved the quality of speech synthesis. But the quality improvement has come at a cost. The quality of the synthesis relies on the fact that little or no signal processing is done on the selected units, thus the style of the recording is maintained in the quality of the synthesis. The synthesis style is implicitly the style of the database. If we want more general flexibility we have to record more data of the desired style. Which means that our already large unit databases must be made even larger. This paper gives examples of how to produce varied style and emotion using existing unit selection synthesis techniques and also highlights the limitations of generating truly flexible synthetic voices.\n",

Generating speech with vocal affect is important for diagnosis, research, and remediation for children with autism and developmental language disorders. However, because vocal affect involves many acoustic factors working together in complex ways, it is unlikely that we will be able to generate compelling vocal affect with traditional diphone synthesis. Instead, methods are needed that preserve as much of the original signals as possible. We describe an approach to concatenative synthesis that attempts to combine the naturalness of unit selection based synthesis with the ability of diphone based synthesis to handle unrestricted input domains.\n",

The aim is to accurately model the voice characteristics of a user on a per-phonetic class basis. The paper describes briefly the implementation of a representation of the voice characteristics in a hierarchy of phonetic classes. We present a framework to easily study the effect of the modeling on the PCBV. A thorough study of the effect of the modeling complexity, the amount of enrollment data and noise conditions is presented. It is shown that Phoneme-based Verification (PBV), a special case of PCBV, is the optimal modeling scheme and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Single GMM modeling even in noisy environments. PBV achieves 9% to 14% relative error rate reduction while cutting the speaker model size by 50% and CPU by 2/3.\n",

    "The performance of speaker verification (SV) systems degrades rapidly in noise rendering them unsuitable for security-critical applications in mobile phones, where false acceptance rates (FAR) of ~ 10^-4 are required. However, less demanding applications for which equal error rates (EER) comparable to word error rates (WER) of speech recognizers are acceptable could benefit from the SV technology. In this paper we evaluate two feature-based noise compensation algorithms in the context of SV: vector Taylor series (VTS) combined with statistical linear approximation (SLA), and Kalman filter-based interacting multiple models (IMM). Tests with the YOHO database and the NTT-AT ambient noises show that EERs as low as 5%-10% in medium to high noise conditions can be achieved for a text-independent SV system.\n",

Besides the definition of the LRPNN architecture a fast three-step training method is proposed.

Finally, the superiority of LRPNNs over PNNs on the task of text-independent speaker verification is demonstrated.\n",

In this paper, we introduce a new method for the task: that using AdaBoost learning based on the GMM. The motivation is the following: While a GMM linearly combines a number of Gaussian models according to a set of mixing weights, we believe that there exists a better means of combining individual Gaussian mixture models. The proposed AdaBoost-GMM method is non-parametric in which a selected set of weak classifiers, each constructed based on a single Gaussian model, is optimally combined to form a strong classifier, the optimality being in the sense of maximum margin. Experiments show that the boosted GMM classifier yields 10.81% relative reduction in equal error rate for the same handsets and 11.24% for different handsets, a significant improvement over the baseline adapted GMM system.\n",

The technique employs cepstral coefficients (LPCCs) derived from G.729 and G.723.1 coder parameters as feature vectors. Based on the LP coefficients derived from the coder parameters, LP residuals are reconstructed, and the verification performance is improved by taking account of the additional speaker-dependent information contained in the reconstructed residuals. This is achieved by adding the LPCCs of the LP residuals to the LPCCs derived from the coder parameters. To reduce the acoustic mismatch between different handsets, a technique combining a handset selector with stochastic feature transformation is employed. Experimental results based on 150 speakers show that the proposed technique outperforms the approaches that only utilize the coder-derived LPCCs.\n",

    "Spoken dialogue systems have a strong requirement to produce concise and informative utterances. While interacting over a phone, users must both understand the system's utterances, and remember important facts that the system is providing. Thus most dialogue systems implement some combination of different techniques for (1) option selection: pruning the set of options; (2) information selection: selecting a subset of information to present about each option; (3) aggregation: combining multiple items of information succinctly. We first describe how user models based on multi-attribute decision theory support domain-independent algorithms for both option selection and information selection. We then describe experiments to determine an optimal level of conciseness in information selection, i.e. how much information to include for an option. Our results show that (a) users are highly oriented to utterance conciseness; (b) the information selection algorithm is highly consistent with user's judgments of conciseness; and (c) the appropriate level of conciseness is both user and dialogue strategy dependent.\n",

    "This paper presents our approach towards natural language response generation for mixed-initiative dialogs in the CUHK Restaurants domain. Our experimental corpus consists of about 4000 customer requests and waiter responses. Every request/response utterance is annotated with its task goal (TG) and dialog act (DA). The variable pair TG, DA is used to represent the dialog state. Our approach involves a set of corpus-derived dialog state transition rules in the form of TG, DA_ request arrow TG, DA_ response. These rules encode the communication goal(s) and initiatives of the request/ response. Another set of hand-designed rules associate each response dialog state with one or more text generation templates. Upon testing, our system parses the input customer request for concept categories and from these infers the TG and DA using trained Belief Networks. Application of the dialog state transition rules and text generation templates automatically generates a (virtual) waiter response. Ten subjects were invited to interact with the system. Performance evaluation based on Grice's maxims gave a mean score of 4 on a five-point Likert scale and a task completion rate of at least 90%.\n",

The communication between the user and the agent was done through speech. If the agent could not complete the job because of some difficulties, it tried to solve the problems through conversations with the user. Different from other spoken dialogue systems, the speech output from the agent was generated directly from the concept, and was synthesized using higher linguistic information. This scheme could largely improve the prosodic quality of speech output. In order to realize the concept to speech conversion, the linguistic information was handled as a tree structure in the whole dialogue process.\n",

    "As the complexity of spoken dialogue systems has increased, there has been increasing interest in spoken language generation (SLG). SLG promises portability across application domains and dialogue situations through the development of application-independent linguistic modules. However in practice, rule-based SLGs often have to be tuned to the application. Recently, a number of research groups have been developing hybrid methods for spoken language generation, combining general linguistic modules with methods for training parameters for particular applications. This paper describes the use of boosting to train a sentence planner to generate recommendations for restaurants in MATCH, a multimodal dialogue system providing entertainment information for New York.\n",

    "We address a dialogue framework for queries on manuals of electric appliances with a speech interface. Users can make queries by unconstrained speech, from which keywords are extracted and matched to the items in the manual. As a result, so many items are usually obtained. Thus, we introduce an effective dialogue strategy which narrows down the items using a tree structure extracted from the manual. Three cost functions are presented and compared to minimize the number of dialogue turns. We have evaluated the system performance on VTR manual query task. The number of average dialogue turns is reduced to 71% using our strategy compared with a conventional method that makes confirmation in turn according to the matching likelihood. Thus, the proposed system helps users find their intended items more efficiently.\n",

    "Widely used declarative approaches to generation in which generation speed is a function of grammar size are not optimal for real-time dialog systems. We argue that a procedural system like the one we present is potentially more efficient for time-critical real-world generation applications as it provides fine-grained control of each processing step on the way from input to output representations. In this way the procedural behaviour of the generator can be tailored to the task at hand. During the generation process, the realizer generates flat deep structures from semantic-pragmatic expressions, then syntactic deep structures from the deep semantic-pragmatic structures and from these syntactic deep structures surface strings. Nine different generation levels can be distinguished and are described in the paper.\n",

    "The accuracy of automatic speech recognizer degrades rapidly when speech was distorted by noise. Robustness against noise arises to be one of the challenge problems. In this paper, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based data imputation approach is presented to improve speech recognition robustness against noise at the front-end of recognizer. Considering the correlation between different filter-banks, the approach realizes missing data imputation by a HMM of L states, each of which has a Gaussian output distribution with full covariance matrix. \"Missing\" data in speech filter-bank vector sequences are recovered by MAP procedure from local optimal state path or marginal Viterbi decoded HMM state sequence. The potential of the approach was tested using speaker independent continuous mandarin speech recognizer with syllable-loop of perplexity 402 for both Gaussian and babble noises each at 6 different SNR levels ranging from 0dB to 25dB, showing a significant improvement in robustness against additive noises.\n",

    "In this paper we describe a generalized classification method for HMM-based speech recognition systems, that uses free energy as a discriminant function rather than conventional probabilities. The discriminant function incorporates a single adjustable temperature parameter T. The computation of free energy can be motivated using an entropy regularization, where the entropy grows monotonically with the temperature. In the resulting generalized classification scheme, the values of T = 0 and T = 1 give the conventional Viterbi and forward algorithms, respectively, as special cases. We show experimentally that if the test data are mismatched with the classifier, classification at temperatures higher than one can lead to significant improvements in recognition performance. The temperature parameter is far more effective in improving performance on mismatched data than a variance scaling factor, which is another apparent single adjustable parameter that has a very similar analytical form.\n",

    "Impulsive noise usually introduces sudden mismatches between the observation features and the acoustic models trained with clean speech, which drastically degrades the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. This paper presents a novel method to directly suppress the adverse effect of impulsive noise on recognition. In this method, according to the noise sensitivity of each feature dimension, the observation vector is divided into several subvectors, each of which is assigned to a suitable flooring threshold. In recognition stage, observation probability of each feature sub-vector is floored at the Gaussian mixture level. Thus, the unreliable relative probability difference caused by impulsive noise is eliminated, and the expected correct state sequence recovers the priority of being chosen in decoding. Experimental evaluations on Aurora2 database show that the proposed method achieves the average error rate reduction (ERR) of 61.62% and 84.32% in simulated impulsive noise and machinegun noise environment, respectively, while maintaining high performance for clean speech recognition.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a noise robust speech recognition method by combination of temporal domain singular value decomposition( SVD) based speech enhancement and Gaussian mixture model(GMM) based speech estimation. The bottleneck of GMM based approach is a noise estimation problem. For this noise estimation problem, we incorporated the adaptive noise estimation in GMM based approach. Furthermore, in order to obtain higher recognition accuracy, we employed a temporal domain SVD based speech enhancement method as a pre-processing module of the GMM based approach. In addition, to reduce the influence of the noise included in the noisy speech, we introduced an adaptive over-subtraction factor into the SVD based speech enhancement. Usually, a noise reduction method has a problem that it degrades the recognition rate because of spectral distortion caused by residual noise occurred through noise reduction and over estimation. To solve the problem in the noise reduction method, acoustic model adaptation is employed by using an unsupervised MLLR to the distorted speech signal. In evaluation on the AURORA2 tasks, our method showed the improvement in relative improvement of clean condition training task.\n",

    "This paper intends to summarize some of the robust feature extraction and acoustic modeling technologies used at Multitel, together with their assessment on some of the ETSI Aurora reference tasks. Ongoing work and directions for further research are also presented. For feature extraction (FE), we are using PLP coefficients. Additive and convolutional noise are addressed using a cascade of spectral subtraction and temporal trajectory filtering. For acoustic modeling (AM), artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used for estimating the HMM state probabilities. At the junction of FE and AM, the multi-band structure provides a way to address the needs of robustness by targeting both processing levels. Robust features within sub-bands can be extracted using a form of discriminant analysis. In this work, this is obtained using sub-band ANN acoustic models. The robust sub-band features are then used for the estimation of state probabilities. These systems are evaluated on the Aurora tasks in comparison to the existing ETSI features. Our baseline system has similar performance than the ETSI advanced features coupled with the HTK back-end. On the Aurora 3 tasks, the multi-band system outperforms the best ETSI results with an average reduction of the word error rate of about 62% with respect to the baseline ETSI system and of about 18% with respect to the advanced ETSI system. This confirm previous positive experience with the multi-band architecture on other databases.\n",

In opposition to the short time Fourier transform (STFT) based time-frequency signal representation, a computationally efficient WPD can lead to better representation of non-stationary parts of the speech signal (consonants). The vowels are well described with an AR model like in LPC analysis. The separately extracted WPD and AR based features are combined together with the usage of modified principal component analysis (PCA) and voiced/unvoiced decision to produce final output feature vector. The noise robustness is improved with the application of the proposed wavelet based denoising algorithm with the modified soft thresholding procedure and the voice activity detection. Speech recognition results on Aurora 3 databases show performance improvement of 47.6% relative to the standard MFCC front-end.\n",

Then, the attention is payed to the different types of features that can be extracted from all-pole model to reduce the overall word error rate. The results show that generally used cepstrum based features, which can be easily extracted from all-pole model, are not the most suitable parameters for ASR, where the input speech is corrupted by different types of real noises. Very good recognition performances were achieved e.g., with discrete or selective all-pole modeling based approaches, or with decorrelated line spectral frequencies.

    "The Aurora 2 database may be used as a benchmark for evaluation of algorithms under noisy conditions. In particular, the clean training/noisy test mode is aimed at evaluating models that are trained on clean data only without further adjustments on the noisy data, i.e. under severe mismatch between the training and test conditions. While several researchers proposed techniques at the front-end level to improve recognition performance over the reference hideen Markov model (HMM) baseline, investigations at the back-end level are sought. In this respect, the goal is to develop acoustic models that are intrinsically less noise sensitive. This paper presents the word accuracy yielded by a non-parametric HMM with connectionist estimates of the emission probabilities, i.e. a neural network is applied instead of the usual parametric (Gaussian mixture) probability densities. A regularization technique, relying on a maximum-likelihood parameter grouping algorithm, is explicitly introduced to increase the generalization capability of the model and, in turn, its noise-robustness. Results show that a 15,43% relative word error rate reduction w.r.t. the Gaussianmixture HMM is obtained by averaging over the different noises and SNRs of Aurora 2 test set A.\n",

Enhancement is used as an extra task to get higher recognition performance on unseen data. We report our results on an isolated word recognition task.

    "An MLP classifier outputs a posterior probability for each class. With noisy data, classification becomes less certain, and the entropy of the posteriors distribution tends to increase providing a measure of classification confidence. However, at high noise levels, entropy can give a misleading indication of classification certainty. Very noisy data vectors may be classified systematically into classes which happen to be most noise-like and the resulting confusion matrix shows a dense column for each noise-like class. In this article we show how this pattern of misclassification in the confusion matrix can be used to derive a linear correction to the MLP posteriors estimate. We test the ability of this correction to reduce the problem of misleading confidence estimates and to enhance the performance of entropy based full-combination multi-stream approach. Better word-error-rates are achieved for Numbers95 database at different levels of added noise. The correction performs significantly better at high SNRs.\n",

    "The degradation of speech recognition performance in real-life environments and through transmission channels is a main embarrassment for many speech-based applications around the world, especially when non-stationary noise and changing channel exist. In this paper, we extend our previous works on Maximum-Likelihood (ML) dynamic channel compensation by introducing a phone-conditioned prior statistic model for the channel bias and applying Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation technique. Compared to the ML based method, the new MAP based algorithm follows with the variations within channels more effectively. The average structural delay of the algorithm is decreased from 400ms to 200 ms, which means it works better for short utterance compensation (as in many real applications). An additional 7~8% character-error-rate relative reduction is observed in telephone-based Mandarin large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). In short utterance test, the word-error-rate relatively reduced 30%.\n",

    "For a connected digits speech recognition task, we have compared the performance of two inexpensive electret microphones with that of a single high quality PZM microphone. Recognition error rates were measured both with and without compensation techniques, where both single-channel and two-channel approaches were used. In all cases the task was recognition at a significant distance (2-6 feet) from the talker's mouth. The results suggest that the wide variability in characteristics among inexpensive electret microphones can be compensated for without explicit quality control, and that this is particularly effective when both single-channel and two-channel techniques are used. In particular, the resulting performance for the inexpensive microphones used together is essentially equivalent to the expensive microphone, and better than for either inexpensive microphone used alone.\n",

    "In October 2002, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) recommended a standard Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR) advanced front-end, ETSI ES202 050 version 1.1.1 (ES202). Many studies use this front-end in noise environments on several languages on connected digit recognition tasks. However, we have not seen the reports of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition using this front-end on a Japanese speech corpus. Since the DSR system is used on several languages and tasks, we conducted large vocabulary continuous speech recognition experiments using ES202 on a Japanese speech corpus in noise environments. Experimental results show that ES202 has better recognition performance than previous DSR front-end, ETSI ES201 050 version 1.1.2 under all conditions. In addition, we focus on the influence on recognition performance of DSR with acoustic mismatches caused by input devices. DSR employs a vector quantization (VQ) algorithm for feature compression so that the VQ distortion is increased by these mismatches. Large VQ distortion increases the speech recognition error rate. To overcome increases in VQ distortion, we have proposed the Bias Removal method (BRM) in previous work. However, this method can not be applied in real-time. Hence, we have proposed the Real-time Bias Removal Method (RBRM) in this paper. The continuous speech recognition experiments on a Japanese speech corpus show that RBRM achieves an 8.7% improvement in the error rate compared to ES202 under noise conditions (SNR=20dB with convolutional noise).\n",

    "This paper describes an extension to an automatic speech recognition system that improves the robustness concerning varying environments. A dedicated control unit tries to derive an optimal set of parameters for a Wiener Filter based noise reduction unit aiming at maximum recognition performances in different environments. The input measure for the control unit is derived from the speech signal. Apart from the SNR level, several other measures are investigated. The controlled parameters are closely related to the strength of the noise reduction. Several non-linear methods such as the Tabulated References and Neural Networks serve as the core of the control unit. Experiments on realistic handsfree as well as non-handsfree speech data show that the word error rate can be reduced by as much as 31% through the proposed methods. An already optimized static configuration of the applied noise reduction hereby serves as the baseline level.\n",

    "It is very important to capture distant-talking speech with high quality for teleconferencing systems or voice-controlled systems. For this purpose, microphone array steering and Fourier spectral subtraction, for example, are ideal candidates. A combination technique using both microphone array steering and Fourier spectral subtraction has also been proposed to improve performance. However, it is difficult for the conventional approach to reduce non-stationary noise, although it is easy to robustly reduce stationary noise. To cope with this problem, we propose a new combination technique with microphone array steering and Fourier / wavelet spectral subtraction. Wavelet spectral subtraction promises to effectively reduce non-stationary noise, because the wavelet transform admits a variable time-frequency resolution on each frequency band. As a result of an evaluation experiment in a real room, we confirmed that the proposed combination technique provides better performance of the ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and NRR (Noise Reduction Rate) than the conventional combination technique.\n",

    "In real acoustic environments, humans communicate with each other through speech by focusing on the target speech among environmental sounds. We can easily identify the target sound from other environmental sounds. For hands-free speech recognition, the identification of the target speech from environmental sounds is imperative. This mechanism may also be important for a self-moving robot to sense the acoustic environments and communicate with humans. Therefore, this paper first proposes Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based environmental sound source identification. Environmental sounds are modeled by three states of HMMs and evaluated using 92 kinds of environmental sounds. The identification accuracy was 95.4%. This paper also proposes a new HMM composition method that composes speech HMMs and an HMM of categorized environmental sounds for robust environmental sound-added speech recognition. As a result of the evaluation experiments, we confirmed that the proposed HMM composition outperforms the conventional HMM composition with speech HMMs and a noise (environmental sound) HMM trained using noise periods prior to the target speech in a captured signal.\n",

    "This paper introduces a novel statistical approach for combination of multiple features, assuming no knowledge about the identity of the noisy features. In a given set of features, some of the features may be dominated by noise. The proposed model deals with the uncertainty about the noisy features by deriving the joint probability of a subset of features with highest probabilities. The core of the model lies in the determination the number of features to be included in the feature-subset - this is estimated based on calculating the reliability of each feature, which is defined as its normalized probability, and evaluating the joint maximal reliability. For the evaluation, we used the TIDIGITS database for connected digit recognition. The utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise, which resulted the number and identity of the noisy features varied over time (or changed suddenly). The experimental results show that the high-likelihood model achieves recognition performance similar to the one obtained with a full a-priori knowledge about the identity of the noisy features.\n",

    "Noise robustness is one of the most challenging problems in speech recognition research. In this work, we propose a noise robust and computationally simple system for small vocabulary speech recognition. We approach the noise robust digit recognition problem with the missing frames idea. The key point behind the missing frames idea is that frames with energies below a certain threshold are considered unreliable frames. We set these frames to a silence floor and treat them as silence frames. Performing this operation only in decoding stage creates high mismatch between trained speech and decoded speech. To solve the mismatch problem, we apply the same thresholding algorithm on the training data before training. The algorithm adds a negligible computational complexity at the front end, and decreases the overall computational complexity. Moreover, it outperforms other computationally comparable, well known methods. This makes the proposed system particularly suitable for real-time systems.\n",

    "The performance of speech recognition systems trained in quiet degrades significantly under noisy conditions. To address this problem, a Weighted Viterbi Recognition (WVR) algorithm that is a function of the SNR of each speech frame is proposed. Acoustic models trained on clean data, and the acoustic front-end features are kept unchanged in this approach. Instead, a confidence/robustness factor is assigned to the output observation probability of each speech frame according to its SNR estimate during the Viterbi decoding stage. Comparative experiments are conducted with Weighted Viterbi Recognition with different front-end features such as MFCC, LPCC and PLP. Results show consistent improvements with all three feature vectors. For a reasonable size of adaptation data, WVR outperforms environment adaptation using MLLR.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a novel method of normalizing the voice quality in an utterance for both clean speech and speech contaminated by noise. The normalization method is applied to the N-best hypotheses from an HMM-based classifier, then an SM (Sub-space Method)-based verifier tests the hypotheses after normalizing the monophone scores together with the HMM-based likelihood score. The HMM-SM-based speech recognition system was proposed previously [1, 2] and successfully implemented on a speaker-independent word recognition task and an OOV word rejection task. We extend the proposed system to a connected digit string recognition task by exploring the effect of the voice quality normalization in an utterance for robust ASR and compare it with the HMM-based recognition systems with utterance-level normalization, word-level normalization, monophone-level normalization, and state-level normalization. Experimental results performed on connected 4- digit strings showed that the word accuracy was significantly improved from 95.7% obtained by the typical HMM-based system with utterance-level normalization to 98.2% obtained by the HMM-SM-based system for clean speech, from 88.1% to 91.5% for noise-added speech with SNR=10dB, and from 72.4% to 76.4% for noise-added speech with SNR=5dB, while the other HMM-based systems also showed lower performances.\n",

The framework of Environmental Sniffing is focused on detection, classification and tracking changing acoustic environments. Here, we extend the framework to detect and track acoustic environmental conditions in a noisy-speech audio stream. Knowledge extracted about the acoustic environmental conditions is used to determine which environment dependent acoustic model to use. Critical Performance Rate (CPR), previously considered in [1], is formulated and calculated for this task. The sniffing framework is compared to a ROVER solution for automatic speech recognition (ASR) using different noise conditioned recognizers in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) and CPU usage. Results show that the model matching scheme using the knowledge extracted from the audio stream by Environmental Sniffing does a better job than a ROVER solution both in accuracy and computation. A relative 11.1% WER improvement is achieved with a relative 75% reduction in CPU resources.\n",

    "The time derivatives of speech energy, such as the delta and the delta-delta log energy, have been known as critical features for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, their discriminative ability in lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) could be limited or even becomes harmful because of the corruption of energy contour. By taking the advantage of the spectral characteristic of in-car noise, the speech energy contour is extracted from the high-pass filtered signal so as to reduce the distortion in the delta energy. Such filtering can be implemented by using a pre-emphasis-like filter or a summation of higher frequency band energies. A Chinese name recognition task is conducted to evaluate the proposed method by using real in-car speech and artificially generated one as the test data. As shown in the experimental results, the method is capable of improving the recognition accuracy of in-car speech in lower SNR as well as of the clean speech.\n",

The HMM with the LNDs was firstly evaluated in comparison with a standard HMM with NDs in an experiment using an isolated spoken-word recognition task with clean speech. Then noise robustness was tested with four types of additive noise. In the case of DPFs as an input feature vector set, the proposed HMM with the LNDs can outperform the standard HMM with the NDs in the isolated spoken-word recognition task both with clean speech and with speech contaminated by additive noise. Furthermore, we achieved significant improvements over a baseline system with MFCC and dynamic feature-set when combining the DPFs with static MFCCs and (Delta)P.\n",

    "In this paper, the Stochastic Weighted Viterbi (SWV) decoding is combined with language modeling, which in turn guides the Viterbi decoding in those intervals where the information provided by noisy frames is not reliable. In other words, the knowledge from higher layers (e.g. language model) compensates the low accuracy of the information provided by the acoustic-phonetic modeling where the original clean speech signal is not reliably estimated. Bigram and trigram language models are tested, and in combination with spectral subtraction, the SWV algorithm can lead to reductions as high as 20% or 45% in word error rate (WER) using a rough estimation of the additive noise made in a short non-speech interval. Also, the results presented here suggest that the higher the language model accuracy, the higher the improvement due to SWV. This paper proposes that the problem of noise robustness in speech recognition should be classified in two different contexts: firstly, at the acoustic-phonetic level only, as in small vocabulary tasks with flat language model; and, by integrating noise canceling with the information from higher layers.\n",

This can be partially avoided by adding a dereverberation algorithm as a speech signal preprocessing step. The purpose of this paper is to compare the effect of different speech dereverberation algorithms on the performance of a recognition system. Experiments were conducted on the Wall Street Journal dictation benchmark. Reverberation was added to the clean acoustic data in the benchmark both by simulation and by re-recording the data in a reverberant room. Moreover additive noise was added to investigate its effect on the dereverberation algorithms. We found that dereverberation based on a delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm has the best performance of the investigated algorithms.\n",

    "The aim of this work is to improve the robustness of speech recognition systems operating in burst-like packet loss. First a set of highly artificial packet loss profiles are used to analyse their effect on both recognition performance and on the underlying feature vector stream. This indicates that the simple technique of vector repetition can make the recogniser robust to high percentages of packet loss, providing burst lengths are reasonably short. This leads to the proposal of interleaving the feature vector sequence, prior to packetisation, to disperse bursts of packet loss throughout the feature vector stream. Recognition results on the Aurora connected digits database show considerable accuracy gains across a range of packet losses and burst lengths. For example at a packet loss rate of 50% with an average burst length of 4 packets (corresponding to 8 static vectors) performance is increased from 49.4% to 88.5% with an increase in delay of 90ms.\n",

    "This paper uses transform coding for compressing feature vectors in distributed speech recognition applications. Feature vectors are first grouped together into non-overlapping blocks and a transformation applied. A non-uniform allocation of bits to the elements of the resultant matrix is based on their relative information content. Analysis of the amplitude distribution of these elements indicates that non-linear quantisation is more appropriate than linear quantisation. Comparative results, based on speech recognition accuracy, confirm this. RASTA filtering is also considered as is shown to reduce the temporal variation of the feature vector stream. Recognition tests demonstrate that compression to bits rates of 2400bps, 1200bps and 800bps has very little effect on recognition accuracy for both clean and noisy speech. For example at a bit rate of 1200bps, recognition accuracy is 98.0% compared to 98.6% with no compression.\n",

    "This paper presents a novel predictive information criterion (PIC) for hidden Markov model (HMM) selection. The PIC criterion is exploited to select the best HMMs, which provide the largest prediction information for generalization of future data. When the randomness of HMM parameters is expressed by a product of conjugate prior densities, the prediction information is derived without integral approximation. In particular, a multivariate t distribution is attained to characterize the prediction information corresponding to HMM mean vector and precision matrix. When performing HMM selection in tree structure HMMs, we develop a top-down prior/posterior propagation algorithm for estimation of structural hyperparameters. The prediction information is accordingly determined so as to choose the best HMM tree model. The parameters of chosen HMMs can be rapidly computed via maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In the evaluation of continuous speech recognition using decision tree HMMs, the PIC model selection criterion performs better than conventional maximum likelihood and minimum description length criteria in building a compact tree structure with moderate tree size and higher recognition rate.\n",

    "This paper addresses listening to three simultaneous talkers by a humanoid with two microphones. In such situations, sound separation and automatic speech recognition (ASR) of the separated speech are difficult, because the number of simultaneous talkers exceeds that of its microphones, the signal-to-noise ratio is quite low (around -3 dB) and noise is not stable due to interfering voices. Humanoid audition system consists of sound separation, face recognition and ASR. Sound sources are separated by an active direction-pass filter (ADPF), which extracts sounds from a specified direction in real-time. Since features of sounds separated by ADPF vary according to the sound direction, ASR uses multiple direction- and speaker-dependent acoustic models. The system integrates ASR results by using the sound direction and speaker information by face recognition as well as confidence measure of ASR results to select the best one. The resulting system improves word recognition rates against three simultaneous utterances.\n",

    "This paper proposes a new method of detecting mis-recognized utterances based on a ROVER-like voting scheme. Although the ROVER approach is effective in improving recognition accuracy, it has two serious problems from a practical point of view: 1) it is difficult to construct multiple automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, 2) the computational cost increase according to the number of ASR systems. To overcome these problems, a new method is proposed where only a single acoustic engine is employed but multiple language models (LMs) consisting of a baseline (main) LM and sub LMs are used. The sub LMs are generated by clustered sentences and used to rescore the word lattice given by the main LM. As a result, the computational cost is greatly reduced. Through experiments, the proposed method resulted in 18-point higher precision with 10% loss of recall when compared with the baseline, and 22- point higher precision with 20% loss of recall.\n",

    "Developing a real-life spoken dialogue system must face with many practical issues, where the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words problem is one of the key difficulties. This paper presents the OOV detection mechanism based on the word confidence scoring developed for the d-Ear Attendant system, a spontaneous spoken dialogue system. In the d-Ear Attendant system, an explicit filler model is originally used to detect the presence of OOV words [1]. Although this approach has a satisfactory OOV detection rate, it badly degrades the accuracy of in-vocabulary (IV) detection by 4.4% absolutely (from 97% to 92.6%). Such the degradation will not be acceptable in a practical system. By using a few commonly used acoustic confidence features and some new context confidence features, our confidence measure method not only is able to detect the word level speech recognition errors, but also has a good ability for OOV words detection with an acceptable false alarm rate. For example, with a false rejection rate of 2.5%, the false acceptance rate of 26% is achieved.\n",

    "The cellular phone offers significant benefits but causes several social problems. One such problem is phone use in places where people should not speak, such as trains and libraries. A communication style that would not require voiced speech has the potential to solve this problem. Speech recognition based on electromyography (EMG), which we call \"Mime Speech Recognition\" is proposed. It not only eases communication in socially sensitive environments, but also improves speech recognition accuracy in noisy environments. In this paper, we report that EMG yields stable and accurate recognition of 5 Japanese vowels uttered statically without generating voice. Moreover, the ability of EMG to handle consonants is described, and the feasibility of basing comprehensive speech recognition systems on EMG is shown.\n",

    "We propose a new method of automatically creating non-uniform context-dependent HMM topologies by using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Phonetic decision tree clustering is widely used, based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion, and creates only contextual variations. However, it also needs to empirically predetermine control parameters for use as stop criteria, for example, the total number of states. Furthermore, it cannot create topologies with various state lengths automatically. Therefore, we introduce the MDL criterion as split and stop criteria, and use the Successive State Splitting (SSS) algorithm as a method of generating contextual and temporal variations. This proposed method, the MDL-SSS, can automatically create proper topologies without such predetermined parameters. Experimental results show that the MDLSSS can automatically stop splitting and obtain more appropriate HMM topologies than the original one. Furthermore, we investigated the MDL-SSS combined with phonetic decision tree clustering, and this method can automatically obtain the best performance with any heuristic.\n",

    "An automatic speech recognizer uses acoustic knowledge and linguistic knowledge. In large vocabulary speech recognition, acoustic knowledge is modeled by hidden Markov models (HMM), linguistic knowledge is modeled by N-gram (typically bi-gram or trigram), and these models are stochastically integrated. It is thought that humans also integrate acoustic and linguistic knowledge of speech when perceiving continuous speech. Automatic speech recognition with HMM and N-gram is thought to roughly model the process of human perception.\n",
    "Although these models have drastically improved the performance of automatic speech recognition of well-formed read speech so far, they cannot deliver sufficient performance on spontaneous speech recognition tasks because of various particular phenomena of spontaneous speech.\n",
    "In this paper, we conducted simulation experiments of N-gram language models by combining human acoustic knowledge and instruction of local context and assured that using two words neighboring the target word was enough to improve the performance of recognition when we could use only local information as linguistic knowledge. We also assured that coarticulation affected the perception of short words.\n",
    "We then compared some language models on speech recognizer. We calculated acoustic scores with HMM and then linguistic scores calculated from a language model were added. We obtained 37.5% recognition rate only with acoustic model, whereas we obtained 51.0% with both acoustic and language models, thus the relative performance improvement was 36%. On the other hand, we obtained a 16.5% recognition rate only with the language model, so the acoustic model improved the performance relatively 209%. The performance of the language model on spontaneous speech is almost equal to that on read speech and thus, the improvements of the acoustic models is more effective than that of the language model.\n",

These methods make use of the information contained in the data-source, because, in IP networks, unlike in cellular networks, no information is received during packet losses. When a packet loss occurs, the lost information can be reconstructed through estimations from the N nearest received packets. Due to the enormous amount of combinations from previous and next received speech vector sequences, we have developed a methodology that drastically reduces the amount of required estimations.\n",

    "We present a novel multi-level HMM in which an intermediate `articulatory' representation is included between the state and surface-acoustic levels. A potential difficulty with such a model is that advantages gained by the introduction of an articulatory layer might be compromised by limitations due to an insufficiently rich articulatory representation, or by compromises made for mathematical or computational expediency. This paper describes a simple model in which speech dynamics are modelled as linear trajectories in a formant-based `articulatory' layer, and the articulatory-to-acoustic mappings are linear. Phone classification results for TIMIT are presented for monophone and triphone systems with a phone-level syntax. The results demonstrate that provided the intermediate representation is sufficiently rich, or a sufficiently large number of phone-class-dependent articulatory-to-acoustic mapping are employed, classification performance is not compromised. Presentamos un nuevo HMM multinivel en el que una representacion `articulatoria' intermedia se incluye entre el nivel de estados y el acustico de superficie. Una dificultad potencial con tal modelo es que las ventajas ganadas por la introduccion de una capa articulatoria quizas sean cedidas por limitaciones debidas a una representacion articulatoria insuficientemente rica, o por cesiones realizadas por conveniencia matematica o computacional. Este articulo describe un modelo sencillo en el cual la dinamica del habla se modela como trayectorias lineales en una capa articulatoria basada en formantes, y las proyecciones acustico-articulatorias son lineales. Los resultados de la clasificacion de fonemas para TIMIT se presentan para sistemas de monofonemas y trifonemas con una sintaxis a nivel de fonema. Los resultados demuestran que la representacion intermedia es suficientemente rica, o se emplea un numero suficientemente grande de proyecciones acustico-articulatorias dependiente de la clase de fonema, donde no se comprometen las prestaciones de la clasificacion.\n",

    "Extending the phone set is one common approach for dealing with phonetic confusions in spontaneous speech. We propose using likelihood ratio test as a confidence measure for automatic phone set extension to model phonetic confusions. We first extend the standard phone set using dynamic programming (DP) alignment to cover all possible phonetic confusions in training data. Likelihood ratio test is then used as a confidence measure to optimize the extended phonetic units to represent the acoustic samples between two standard phonetic units with high confusability. The optimum set of extended phonetic units is combined with the standard phone set to form a multiple pronunciation dictionary. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated on spontaneous Mandarin telephony speech. It gives an encouraging 1.09% absolute syllable error rate reduction. Using the extended phone set provides a good balance between the demands of high resolution acoustic model and the available training data.\n",

    "This paper shows an efficient voice activity detector (VAD) that is based on the estimation of the long-term spectral divergence (LTSD) between noise and speech periods. The proposed method decomposes the input signal into overlapped speech frames, uses a sliding window to compute the long-term spectral envelope and measures the speech/non-speech LTSD, thus yielding a high discriminating decision rule and minimizing the average number of decision errors. In order to increase nonspeech detection accuracy, the decision threshold is adapted to the measured noise energy while a controlled hang-over is activated only when the observed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. An exhaustive analysis of the proposed VAD is carried out using the AURORA TIdigits and SpeechDat-Car (SDC) databases. The proposed VAD is compared to the most commonly used ones in the field in terms of speech/non-speech detection and recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate a sustained advantage over G.729, AMR and AFE VADs.\n",

    "A new simple but robust method of front-end analysis, nonlinear spectral smoothing (NLSS), is proposed. NLSS uses rank-order filtering to replace noisy low-level speech spectrum coefficients with values computed from adjacent spectral peaks. The resulting transformation bears significant similarities with masking in the auditory system. It can be used as an intermediate processing stage between the FFT and the filter-bank analyzer. It also produces features which can be cosine transformed and used by a pattern matcher. NLSS gives significant improvements in the performance of speech recognition systems in the presence of stationary noise, a reduction in error rate of typically 50% or an increased tolerance to noise of 3dB for the same error rate in an isolated digit test on the Noisex database. Results on female speech were superior to those on male speech: female speech gave a recognition error rate of 1.1% at a 0dB signal to noise ratio.\n",

    "Automatic speech recognition works quite well in clean conditions, and several algorithms have already been proposed to deal with stationary noise. The next challenge consists to work with non-stationary noise. This paper studies this problem. We propose three algorithms to non-stationary noise adaptation : Static and Dynamic Optional Parallel Model Combination (OPMC) and one algorithm derived from the Missing Data framework. The combination of speech and noise is expressed in the spectral domain and different ways to estimate the non-stationary noise model are studied. The proposed algorithms are tested on a telephone database with added background music at different SNRs. The best result is obtained using dynamic OPMC.\n",

    "This paper addresses the problem of channel effect in the line spectrum frequency (LSF) domain. The channel effect can be expressed in terms of the channel phase. The speech signal is represented by its inverse filter derived from LP analysis. Then the mean normalization on the inverse filters is introduced for removing the channel distortion. Further study indicates that the mean normalization on the inverse filters becomes the mean subtraction in phase domain. Based on this finding, two methods are proposed to compensate the channel effect. Experiments on simulated channel distorted speech are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can give significant improvements in speech recognition performance. The performance of the proposed methods is comparable to that of CMN in using cepstral coefficients.\n",

Applied to spectral features for noisy speech recognition, the clean feature values are known to be less than the observed noisy features. Based on this inequality constraint, an HMM-state-dependent clean speech value of the missing features can be inferred through maximum likelihood estimation.

    "In the context of automatic speech recognition, the popular Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) as features, though perform very well under clean and matched environments, are observed to fail in mismatched conditions. The spectral maxima are often observed to preserve their locations and energies under noisy environments, but are not presented explicitly by the MFCC features. This paper presents a framework for representing the maxima information for robust recognition in the presence of additive White Gaussian Noise(WGN). For the task of phoneme based Isolated Word Recognition (IWR) under different Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) environments, the results show an improved recognition performance. The cepstral features are computed from a reconstructed spectrogram by fitting gaussians around the spectral maxima. In view of the inherent robustness and easy trackability of the maxima, this opens up interesting avenues towards a robust feature representation as well as preprocessing techniques.\n",

For comparison, we also use a tacking method, which recognizes only received data. We evaluate these approaches with packet loss models, i.e., random loss and Gilbert loss models. The results show that the marginal-distributions-based approach is most effective for a packet loss environment; the degradation of word accuracy is only 5% when the packet loss rate is 30% and only 3% when mean burst loss length is 24 frames.\n",

To test the use of the new multi-stream feature vector, a series of experiments on speaker-independent continuous-speech recognition have been carried out using a noisy version of the TIMIT database. Using such multi-stream paradigm, we found that the use of the proposed paradigm, outperforms the conventional recognition process based on the use of the MFCCs in interfering noisy car environments for a wide range of SNRs.\n",

    "When applying Missing Feature Theory to noise robust speech recognition, spectral features are labeled as either reliable or unreliable in the time-frequency plane. The acoustic model evaluation of the unreliable features is modified to express that their clean values are unknown or confined within bounds. Classically, MFT requires an assumption of statistical independence in the spectral domain, which deteriorates the accuracy on clean speech. In this paper, MFT is expressed in any domain that is a linear transform of (log-)spectra, for example for cepstra and their time-derivatives. The acoustic model evaluation is recast as a nonnegative least squares problem. Approximate solutions are proposed and the success of the method is shown through experiments on the AURORA-2 database.\n",

    "In this paper, an iterative bandwidth mismatch compensation (BMC) algorithm is proposed to alleviate the need of multiple pre-trained models for recognizing different bandwidth speech. The BMC uses the concept of the bandwidth extension as similar as in the speech enhancement approaches. However, it aims at directly improving the recognition accuracy instead of speech intelligence or quality and utilizes only recognizer's hidden Markov models (HMMs) for both bandwidth mismatch compensation and recognition. The BMC first detects the bandwidth of the input speech signal based on a divergence measurement. The HMM/Gaussian mixture model (GMM)- based method is then used to iteratively segment the input speech utterance and compensates the speech features. Experiments on serious bandwidth mismatched conditions, i.e., training on 8 kHz and testing on 4 kHz or 5.5 kHz bandwidth database have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",

By using these methods, it is possible to explore new possibilities in leveraging the autoregressive assumption for noise robust feature extraction. Two minimum mean square error estimators are compared that directly estimate the mean of the feature vectors. The first estimator uses the assumption that the speech is an autoregressive signal, while the second makes no assumptions about the speech spectrum. By creating samples from the posterior distribution, these methods also provide an elegant solution to finding feature variances. These variances can be used to create optimal temporal smoothers of the features as well as input for uncertainty observation decoding. Testing on the Aurora2 database shows that autoregressive modeling provides additional information to improve speech recognition performance. In addition, both smoothing and uncertain observation decoding improve performance in this method.\n",

    "A common practice in ASR to add contextual information is to append consecutive feature frames in a single large feature vector. However, this increases the processing time in the acoustic modelling and may lead to poorly trained parameters. A possible solution is to use a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) mapping to reduce the dimensionality of the feature, but this is not optimal, at least in the case where the LDA classes are HMM-states. It is shown in this paper that the feature reduction problem is essentially a problem of approximating class posterior probabilities. These can be approximated using Neural Nets (NN). Some approaches using different choices for the classes and NN topology are presented and tested on the AURORA 2000 digit task and on our in-car task. Results on AURORA show a significant performance increase compared to LDA, but none of the NN-based approaches outperforms LDA on our in-car task.\n",

For unsupervised learning, we utilize the remaining untranscribed data by using their ASR output and word confidence scores.

    "This paper describes an accurate feature representation for continuous clean speech recognition. The main components of the technique involve performing a moderate order Linear Predictive (LP) analysis and computing the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) spectrum from these LP coefficients. This feature representation, PMCCs, was earlier shown to yield superior performance over MFCCs for different noise conditions with emphasis on car noise [1]. The performance improvement was then attributed to better spectrum and envelope modeling properties of the MVDR methodology. This study shows that the representation is also quite efficient for clean speech recognition. In fact, PMCCs are shown to be a more accurate envelope representation and reduce speaker variability. This, in turn, yields a 12.8% relative word error rate (WER) reduction on the combination of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Nov'92 dev/eval sets with respect to the MFCCs. Accurate envelope modeling and reduction in the speaker variability also lead to faster decoding, based on efficient pruning in the search stage. The total gain in the decoding speed is 22.4%, relative to the standard MFCC features. It is also shown that PMCCs are not very demanding in terms of computation when compared to MFCCs. Therefore, we conclude that PMCC feature extraction scheme is a better representation of clean speech as well as noisy speech than MFCC scheme.\n",

    "The decision tree is a popular method to accomplish tying of the states of a set context dependent phone HMMs for efficient and effective training of the large acoustic models. A likelihood-based impurity function is commonly adopted. It is well known that maximizing likelihood does not result in the maximal separation between the distributions in the leaves of the tree. To improve robustness, a discriminative decision tree learning approach is proposed. It embeds the MCE-GPD formulation in defining the impurity function so that the discriminative information could be taken into account while optimizing the tree. We compare the proposed approach with the conventional tree building using a Mandarin syllable recognition task. Our preliminary results show that the separation between the divided subspaces in the tree nodes is clearly enhanced although there is a slight performance reduction.\n",

    "This paper investigates the use of a large corpus for the training of a Broadcast News speech recognizer. A vast body of speech recognition algorithms and mathematical machinery is aimed at smoothing estimates toward accurate modeling with scant amounts of data. In most cases, this research is motivated by a real need for more data. In Broadcast News, however, a large corpus is already available to all LDC members. Until recently, it has not been considered for acoustic training.\n",
    "We would like to pioneer the use of the largest speech corpus (1200h) available for the purpose of acoustic training of speech recognition systems. To the best of our knowledge it is the largest scale acoustic training ever considered in speech recognition. We obtain a performance improvement of 1.5% absolute WER over our best standard (200h) training.\n",

    "This paper proposed two acoustic modelings of the onsetrhyme for speech recognition. The two models are Phonotactic Onset-Rhyme Model (PORM) and Contextual Onset-Rhyme Model (CORM). The models comprise a pair of onset and rhyme units, which makes up a syllable. An onset comprises an initial consonant and its transition towards the following vowel. Together with the onset, the rhyme consists of a steady vowel portion and a final consonant. The experiments have been carried out to find the proper acoustic model, which can accurately model Thai sound and gives higher accuracy. Experimental results show that the onset-rhyme model excels the efficiency of the triphone for both PORM and CORM. The PORM achieves higher syllable accuracy than the CORM 2.74%. Moreover the onset-rhyme models also give a more efficiency in term of system complexity compared to the triphone models.\n",

    "This paper presents a novel approach to tone recognition in continuous Cantonese speech based on overlapped di-tone Gaussian mixture models (ODGMM). The ODGMM is designed with special consideration on the fact that Cantonese tone identification relies more on the relative pitch level than on the pitch contour. A di-tone unit covers a group of two consecutive tone occurrences. The tone sequence carried by a Cantonese utterance can be considered as the connection of such di-tone units. Adjacent di-tone units overlap with each other by exactly one tone. For each di-tone unit, a GMM is trained with a 10-dimensional feature vector that characterizes the F0 movement within the unit. In particular, the di-tone models capture the relative deviation between the F0 levels of the two tones. Viterbi decoding algorithm is adopted to search for the optimal tone sequence, under the phonological constraints on syllable-tone combination. Experimental results show the ODGMM approach significantly outperforms the previously proposed methods for tone recognition in continuous Cantonese speech.\n",

We propose a flexible framework that selects an optimal speaker model (GMM or VQ) based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) according to input utterances. The framework makes it possible to use a discrete model when the data is sparse, and to seamlessly switch to a continuous model after a large cluster is obtained. The speaker indexing is also applied and evaluated at automatic speech recognition of discussions by adapting a speaker-independent acoustic model to each participant. It is demonstrated that indexing with our method is sufficiently accurate for the speaker adaptation.\n",

    "This paper describes experiments carried out to automatically transcribe football commentaries in Dutch, English and German for multimedia indexing. Our results show that the high levels of stadium noise in the material create a task that is extremely difficult for conventional ASR. The baseline WERs vary from 83% to 94% for the three languages investigated. Employing state-of-the-art noise robustness techniques leads to relative reductions of 9-10% WER. Application specific words such as players' names are recognized correctly in about 50% of cases. Although this result is substantially better than the overall result, it is inadequate. Much better results can be obtained if the football commentaries are recorded separately from the stadium noise. This would make the automatic transcriptions more useful for multimedia indexing.\n",

    "This article reports a two-part study of structured acoustic modeling of speech. First, speaker-independent clustering of speech material was used as the basis for a practical cluster-based acoustic modeling. Each cluster's training material is applied to the adaptation of baseline hidden Markov model(HMM)parameters for recognition purposes. Further, the training material of each cluster is also used to train phone-level Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for cluster identification. Test utterances are evaluated on all such models to identify an appropriate cluster or cluster combination. Experiments demonstrate that such cluster-based adaptation can yield accuracy gains over computationally similar baseline models. At the same time, these gains and those of similar methods found in the literature are modest. Hence, the second part of our study examined the limitations of the approach by considering utterance consistency: that is, the ability of acoustically-derived cluster models to uniquely identify a single utterance. These second experiments show that arbitrary pieces of a given utterance are likely to be identified by different clusters, in opposition to an implicit assumption of cluster-based acoustic modeling.\n",

A procedure based on the Nelder-Mead algorithm is proposed to estimate the BPT parameters. Our experimental results include a detailed study of the performance of the BPT compared to other VTLN methods for a subset of speakers and results on large test sets. BPT performs better than other VTLN methods and offers a gain of 1.13% absolute on Hub-5 English Eval01 set.\n",

We show that accurate pronunciation modeling can be achieved through efficient parameter sharing in the acoustic model. Combined with a single pronunciation dictionary, a 1.8% absolute word error rate improvement is achieved on Switchboard, a large vocabulary conversational speech recognition task.\n",

    "In recent years there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to porting speech recognizers to new tasks. Recognition systems are usually tuned to a particular task and porting the system to a new task (or language) is both time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, issues in speech recognition portability are addressed and in particular the development of generic models for speech recognition. Multi-source training techniques aimed at enhancing the genericity of some wide domain models are investigated. We show that multi-source training and adaptation can reduce the performance gap between task-independent and task-dependent acoustic models, and for some tasks even out-perform task-dependent acoustic models. Ces dernieres annees, des efforts considerables ont ete faits pour faciliter le transfert des systemes de reconnaissance de la parole vers de nouvelles taches. Les systemes sont generalement optimises sur une tache particuliere et leur transfert vers une nouvelle tache est fastidieux et tres couteux en temps. Dans ce papier, nous nous interesserons au probleme du transfert des systemes de reconnaissance, en particuliers au travers du developpement de modeles generiques pour la reconnaissance de la parole. Des techniques d'apprentissage multi-source visant a augmenter le niveau de genericite de modeles a large domaine sont etudiees. Nous montrons que l'apprentissage et l'adaptation multi-sources peuvent permettre de reduire l'ecart de performance entre des modeles independants et dependants de la tache, et meme pour certaines taches de depasser les performances des modeles dependants de la tache.\n",

Instead, a modular framework is proposed which allows for the integration of more complex linguistic components. The search process consists of two layers. First, a pure acoustic-phonemic search generates a dense phoneme network enriched with meta-data. Then, the output of the first layer is used by sophisticated language technology components for word decoding in the second layer. Preliminary experiments prove the feasibility of the approach.\n",

    "This paper investigates the use of discriminative schemes based on the maximum mutual information (MMI) and minimum phone error (MPE) objective functions for both task and gender adaptation. A method for incorporating prior information into the discriminative training framework is described. If an appropriate form of prior distribution is used, then this may be implemented by simply altering the values of the counts used for parameter estimation. The prior distribution can be based around maximum likelihood parameter estimates, giving a technique known as I-smoothing, or for adaptation it can be based around a MAP estimate of the ML parameters, leading to MMI-MAP, or MPE-MAP. MMI-MAP is shown to be effective for task adaptation, where data from one task (Voicemail) is used to adapt a HMM set trained on another task (Switchboard). MPE-MAP is shown to be effective for generating gender-dependent models for Broadcast News transcription.\n",

    "Modeling approaches are presented that incorporate discriminative training procedures in segmental Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding (SMBR). SMBR is used to segment lattices produced by a general automatic speech recognition (ASR) system into sequences of separate decision problems involving small sets of confusable words. We discuss two approaches to incorporating these segmented lattices in discriminative training. We investigate the use of acoustic models specialized to discriminate between the competing words in these classes which are then applied in subsequent SMBR rescoring passes. Refinement of the search space that allows the use of specialized discriminative models is shown to be an improvement over rescoring with conventionally trained discriminative models.\n",

    "While the field of Information Retrieval originally had the search for the most relevant documents in mind, it has become increasingly clear that in many instances, what the user wants is a piece of coherent information, derived from a set of relevant documents and possibly other sources. Reducing relevant documents, passages, and sentences to their core is the task of text summarization or information condensation. Applying text-based technologies to speech is not always workable and often not enough to capture speech specific phenomena. In this paper, we will contrast speech summarization with text summarization, give an overview of the history of speech summarization, its current state, and, finally, sketch possible avenues as well as remaining challenges in future research.\n",

    "In this paper we will present work carried out lately on the 50,000 words Italian Spontaneous Speech Corpus called AVIP, under national project API, made available for free download from the website of the coordinator, the University of Naples. We will concentrate on the tuning of the parser for Italian which had been previously used to parse 100,000 words corpus of written Italian within the National Treebank initiative coordinated by ILC in Pisa. The parser receives as input the adequately transformed orthographic transcription of the dialogues making up the corpus, in which pauses, hesitations and other disfluencies have been turned into most likely corresponding punctuation marks, interjections or truncation of the word underlying the uttered segment. The most interesting phenomenon we will discuss is without any doubts \"overlapping\", i.e. a speech event in which two people speak at the same time by uttering actual words or in some cases nonwords, when one of the speakers, usually the one which is not the current turntaker, interrupts the current speaker. This phenomenon takes place at a certain point in time where it has to be anchored to the speech signal but in order to be fully parsed and subsequently semantically interpreted, it needs to be referred semantically to a following turn.\n",

    "For large-scale deployments of speaker verification systems models size can be an important issue for not only minimizing storage requirements but also reducing transfer time of models over networks. Model size is also critical for deployments to small, portable devices. In this paper we present a new model compression technique for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based speaker recognition systems. For GMM systems using adaptation from a background model, the compression technique exploits the fact that speaker models are adapted from a single speaker-independent model and not all parameters need to be stored. We present results on the 2002 NIST speaker recognition evaluation cellular telephone corpus and show that the compression technique provides a good tradeoff of compression ratio to performance loss. We are able to achieve a 56:1 compression (624KB arrow 11KB) with only a 3.2% relative increase in EER (9.1% arrow 9.4%).\n",

The proposed approach uses a hierarchical statistical framework with three levels of specialization for the acoustic modeling. The highest level of specialization is in addition responsible for the modeling of the temporal constraints via a specific Temporal Structure Information (TSI) component. The preliminary results show the ability of the GDW method to elegantly take into account the acoustic variability of speech while capturing important temporal constraints.\n",

    "We present a method for speaker recognition that uses the duration patterns of speech units to aid speaker classification. The approach represents each word and/or phone by a feature vector comprised of either the durations of the individual phones making up the word, or the HMM states making up the phone. We model the vectors using mixtures of Gaussians. The speaker specific models are obtained through adaptation of a \"background\" model that is trained on a large pool of speakers. Speaker models are then used to score the test data; they are normalized by subtracting the scores obtained with the background model. We find that this approach yields significant performance improvement when combined with a state-of-the-art speaker recognition system based on standard cepstral features. Furthermore, the improvement persists even after combination with lexical features. Finally, the improvement continues to increase with longer test sample durations, beyond the test duration at which standard system accuracy level off.\n",

    "In this paper, we report our recent work on speaker segmentation. Without a priori information about speaker number and speaker identities, the audio stream is segmented, and segments of the same speaker are grouped together. Speakers are represented by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), then an HMM network is used for segmentation. However, unlike other model-based segmentation methods, the speaker GMMs are initialized using a simpler distance based segmentation algorithm. To group segments of identical speakers, a two-level clustering mechanism is introduced, which we found to achieve higher accuracy than direct distance based clustering methods. Our method significantly outperforms the best result reported at the 2002 Speaker Recognition Workshop. When tested on a professionally produced TV program set, our system reports only 3.5% frame errors.\n",

    "Data-driven grapheme-to-phoneme conversion involves either (top-down) inductive learning or (bottom-up) pronunciation by analogy. As both approaches rely on local context information, they typically require some external linguistic knowledge, e.g., individual grapheme/phoneme correspondences. To avoid such supervision, this paper proposes an alternative solution, dubbed pronunciation by latent analogy, which adopts a more global definition of analogous events. For each out-of-vocabulary word, a neighborhood of globally relevant pronunciations is constructed through an appropriate data-driven mapping of its graphemic form. Phoneme transcription then proceeds via locally optimal sequence alignment and maximum likelihood position scoring. This method was successfully applied to the synthesis of proper names with a large diversity of origin.\n",

We show that the performance of our best model, the joint n-gram model, compares favorably with the best results for English grapheme-to-phoneme conversion reported in the literature, sometimes by a wide margin.

Experiment 1, using sentence stimuli, and Experiment 2, using discrete word stimuli, investigate the effect of voice gender and signal quality on the intelligibility of three TTS synthesis systems from the user's point of view. Accuracy scores and reaction time were recorded as on-line, implicit indices of intelligibility during phoneme detection tasks. It was hypothesized that male voice TTS would be more intelligible than female voice TTS, and that low quality signals would reduce intelligibility. Results indicate an interaction between voice gender and signal quality which is dependent on the TTS system. We suggest that intelligibility from the user's perspective is modulated by several factors and there is a need to tailor systems to particular commercial applications. Methods to achieve commercially relevant evaluation of TTS synthesis are discussed.\n",

An improved formant model based on linear prediction (LP) feature analysis and a 2-D hidden Markov model (HMM) of formants is employed for estimation of the formant trajectories of vowels and diphthongs. Comparative analysis of the formant values, the formant trajectories and the formant target points of British and broad Australian accents are presented. A method for ranking the contribution of formants to accent identity is proposed whereby formants are ranked according to the normalised distances between formants across accents. The first two formants are considered more sensitive to accents than other formants. Finally a set of experiments on accent conversion is presented to transform the broad Australian accent of a speaker to British Received Pronunciation (RP) accent by formant mapping and prosody modification. Perceptual evaluations of accent conversion results illustrate that besides prosodic correlates such as pitch and duration, formants also play an important role in conveying accents.\n",

    "In this paper we present a speech synthesis method for diphone-based text-to-speech systems. Its main goal is to achieve prosodic modifications that result in more natural-sounding synthetic speech. This improvement is especially useful for emotional speech synthesis, which requires high-quality prosodic modification. We present a hybrid method based on TD-PSOLA and the harmonic plus noise model, which incorporates a novel method to jointly modify pitch and time-scale. Preliminary results show an improvement in the synthetic speech quality when high pitch modification is required.\n",

    "This paper presents a framework for custom-tailoring voice font in data-driven TTS systems. Three criteria for unit pruning, the prosodic outlier criterion, the importance criterion and the combination of the two, are proposed. The performance of voice fonts in different sizes which are pruned with the three criteria is evaluated by simulating speech synthesis over large amount of texts and estimating the naturalness with an objective measure at the same time. The result shows that the combined criterion performs the best among the three. The pre-estimated curve for naturalness vs. database size might be used as a reference for custom-tailoring voice font. The naturalness remains almost unchanged when 50% of instances are pruned off with the combined criterion.\n",

    "Phonemic restoration refers to the synthesis of masked phonemes in speech when sufficient lexical context is present. Current models for phonemic restoration however, make no use of lexical knowledge. Such models are inherently inadequate for restoring unvoiced phonemes and may be limited in their ability to restore voiced phonemes too. We present a predominantly top-down model for phonemic restoration. The model uses a missing data speech recognition system to recognize speech utterances as words and activates word templates corresponding to the words containing the masked phonemes. An activated template is dynamically time warped to the noisy word and is then used to restore the speech frames corresponding to the masked phoneme, thereby synthesizing it. The model is able to restore both voiced and unvoiced phonemes. Systematic testing shows that this model performs significantly better than a Kalman-filter based model.\n",

    "A perceptual study has been performed to investigate relationship between acoustic parameters and the voice-individuality making use of a pitch synchronous analysis-synthesis system. Voice-individuality is involved in many acoustic parameters and the aim of this experiment is to examine how individual parameters affect the voice-individuality by separately giving them some distortions. Formant-frequency shift and bandwidth manipulations are given for spectral distortion, F_0-shift for source manipulation. As the waveform distortion, zero-crossing and center-clipping techniques are used. It has been found that formant-shift is very sensitive to voice-individuality change and F_0-shift and bandwidth manipulations are rather tolerant to the voice-individuality. The results of waveform manipulation reveal that the voice-individuality is kept more than the phonetic information for zero-crossing distortion and the results for center-clipping distortion are reverse.\n",

This paper attempts to clarify how Japanese who are in their twenties distinguish a high level pitch-accent pattern from a level pitch-accent pattern (hereafter LHH) as a form of perception experiment, using speech synthesis techniques. In the first part of this paper, it will be shown how often HHH patterns appear among 10 Japanese college students' production experiment and the F0 configurations will be investigated. Then, the result of perception experiment indicates that HHH patterns are taken for LHH patterns in faster speech. Finally, it will be suggested that durational differences caused by pitch-accent patterns can be perceptual cues in telling the pitch-accent patterns apart.\n",

    "Illusory continuity is known as a psychoacoustical phenomenon in hearing; i.e. an intermittent pure tone may be perceived as if it was continuous, when it is padded with enough large white noise. There are many researches related to this issue in monaural listening. It is said that such illusory continuity is observed when there is no evidence of discontinuity and level of the white noise is large enough to mask the pure tone. In this paper, we investigated illusory continuity in binaural listening, and measured its threshold levels according to some interaural time differences (ITDs). The ITDs simulate a sense of direction about sound sources and give new information for evidence of discontinuity, which should be expected to promote the illusory continuity. As a result, the threshold level of illusory continuity in binaural listening depended on ITDs between tone target and noise masker. The increase of threshold level was minimum when the target and masker had the same ITD.\n",

    "This study aims at automatically estimating probability of individual words of Japanese English (JE) being perceived correctly by American listeners and clarifying what kinds of (combinations of) segmental, prosodic, and linguistic errors in the words are more fatal to their correct perception. From a JE speech database, a balanced set of 360 utterances by 90 male speakers are firstly selected. Then, a listening experiment is done where 6 Americans are asked to transcribe all the utterances. Next, using speech and language technology, values of many segmental, prosodic, and linguistic attributes of the words are extracted. Finally, relation between transcription rate of each word and its attribute values is analyzed with Classification And Regression Tree (CART) method to predict probability of each of the JE words being transcribed correctly. The machine prediction is compared with the human prediction of seven teachers and this method is shown to be comparable to the best American teacher. This paper also describes differences in perceiving intelligibility of the pronunciation between American and Japanese teachers.\n",

    "Sine-wave speech (SWS) is a three-tone replica of speech, conventionally created by matching each constituent sinusoid in amplitude and frequency with the corresponding vocal tract resonance (formant). We propose an alternative technique where we take a high-quality multicomponent sinusoidal representation and decimate this model so that there are only three components per frame. In contrast to SWS, the resulting signal contains only components that were present in the original signal. Consequently it preserves the harmonic fine structure of voiced speech. Perceptual studies indicate that this signal is judged more natural and intelligible than SWS. Furthermore, its tonal artifacts can mostly be eliminated by the introduction of only a few additional components, which leads to an intriguing speculation about grouping issues.\n",

The method is based on comparing the output speech to an appropriate reference representing the closest match from a pre-formulated codebook containing optimally clustered speech parameter vectors extracted from a large number of various undistorted clean speech records. The objective auditory distances between vectors of the distorted speech and their corresponding matching references are then measured and appropriately converted into an equivalent subjective score. The optimal clustering of the reference codebook is achieved by a dynamic k-means method. A self-organising map algorithm is used to match the distorted speech vectors to the references. Speech parameters derived from Bark spectrum analysis, Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are used to provide speaker independent parametric representation of the speech signals as required by an output-based quality measure.\n",

    "Three experiments examined lexical competition effects using the phonological priming paradigm in a shadowing task. Experiment 1 replicated Hamburger and Slowiaczek' s [1] finding of an initial overlap inhibition when primes and targets share three phonemes (/b(textscr) iz/-/b(textscr) ik/) but not when they share two phonemes (/b(textscr)(textepsilon) z/-/b(textscr) ik/). This observation suggests that lexical competition depends on the number of shared phonemes between primes and targets. However, Experiment 2 showed that an overlap of two phonemes was sufficient to cause inhibition when the primes mismatched the targets only on the last phoneme (/bol/-/bot/). Conversely, using a three phonemes overlap, no inhibition was observed in Experiment 3 when the primes mismatched the targets on the last twophonemes (/ba(textscriptg)(textepsilon) t/-/ba(textscriptg) aj/). The data indicate that what essentially determines prime-target competition effects in word-form priming is the number of mismatching phonemes.\n",

We will show that SpeM, in combination with an automatic phone recogniser (APR), is able to simulate the human speech recognition process from the acoustic signal to the ultimate recognition of words. This joint model takes an acoustic speech file as input and calculates the activation flows of candidate words on the basis of the degree of fit of the candidate words with the input. Experiments showed that SpeM outperforms Shortlist on the recognition of `real-life' input. Furthermore, SpeM performs only slightly worse than an off-the-shelf full-blown automatic speech recogniser in which all words are equally probable, while it provides a transparent computationally elegant paradigm for modelling word activations in human word recognition.\n",

Speech perception of twenty Israeli university students, native speakers of Arabic (L1), with Hebrew as L2, was tested. The tests consisted of CHABA sentences adapted to Hebrew and Arabic. In each language, speech perception was evaluated under four conditions: quiet + regular speaking rate, quiet + fast speaking rate, noise + regular speaking rate, and noise + fast speaking rate. Results show that under optimal conditions bilingual speakers of Arabic and Hebrew have similar achievements in Arabic (L1) and Hebrew (L2). Under difficult conditions, performance was poorer in L2 than in L1. The lowest scores were in the combined condition. This reflects bilinguals' disadvantages when listening to L2.\n",

This paper^1 describes a subjective test for the investigation of the relevance of four acoustic features in this process: vocal tract, pitch, duration, and energy. PSOLA based methods provide the framework for the transplantations of these acoustic features between two speakers. The test database consists of different combinations of transplantation outputs obtained from a database of 8 speakers. Subjective decisions on speaker similarity indicate that the vocal tract is the most relevant feature for single feature transplantations. Pitch and duration possess similar significance whereas the energy is the least important acoustic feature. Vocal tract + pitch + duration transplantation results in the highest similarity to the target speaker. Vocal tract + pitch, vocal tract + duration + energy and vocal tract + duration transplantations also yield convincing results in transformation of the perceived speaker identity.

These demonstrations suggest that the model is able to operate in the same optimal way as human listeners. Second, we discuss how to relate the behaviour of a recogniser, designed to discover the optimum path through a word lattice, to data from human listening experiments. We argue that this requires a metric that combines both path-based and word-based measures of recognition performance.

    "Recently, high-speed multimedia communication systems have become widespread. Not only conventional narrow band speech signal (up to 3.4 kHz) but also wide band speech signal (up to 7 kHz) can be transmitted through high-speed communication lines. Generally, the quality of wide band speech signal is high and its articulation score is good for normal-hearing people, but for elderly people who have hearing losses in higher frequencies, the effect of wide band speech is doubtful. Therefore, we investigated the effect of wide band phone speech on the elderly people's speech perception in terms of articulation. And we also considered the effect of amplitude compression method that is used for hearing aids. Japanese 62 CV syllables were used as test speech samples. The original speech samples were re-sampled to narrow band speech (8 kHz sampling) and wide band speech (16 kHz sampling). All speech samples were processed with AMRCODEC (Adaptive Multi Rate COder-DECoder), which is a voice coding system available to both narrow band and wide band speech signals. Then, coded speech signals were processed with a multi-band amplitude compression method. Ratios of the compression in each frequency bands were determined according to the average value of subjects' hearing levels. All subjects were native Japanese speakers, aged 68 to 72 years, and have hearing losses (more than 40 dB HL). From the results of the test, we found that combination of wide band speech and amplitude compression showed significant improvement of the articulation.\n",

The present study has attempted to investigate this proposal with Japanese school children without knowledge of Roman alphabet. The main question addressed in this study is to test whether Japanese school children without Roman alphabet could activate word candidates on the basis of phonemes. An experiment was conducted with 21 Japanese elementary school children who were preliterate in Roman letters, employing a word reconstruction task. The results show that regardless of absence of alphabetic knowledge they could reconstruct Japanese words just like Japanese adults. This suggests that the current word activation model may equally be applicable to Japanese children as well as adults who are mora-based language users.\n",

    "Unlike automatic speech recognition systems, humans can understand speech when other competing sounds are present Although the theory of auditory scene analysis (ASA) may help to explain this ability, some perceptual experiments show fusion of the speech signal under circumstances in which ASA principles might be expected to cause segregation. We propose a model of multi-resolution ASA that uses both high- and low- resolution representations of the auditory signal in parallel in order to resolve this conflict. The use of parallel representations reduces variability for pattern-matching while retaining the ability to identify and segregate low-level features of the signal. An important feature of the model is the assumption that features of the auditory signal are fused together unless there is good reason to segregate them. Speech is recognised by matching the low-resolution representation to previously learned speech templates without prior segregation of the signal into separate perceptual streams; this contrasts with the approach generally used by computational models of ASA. We describe an implementation of the multi-resolution model, using hidden Markov models, that illustrates the feasibility of this approach and achieves much higher identification performance than standard techniques used for computer recognition of speech mixed with other sounds.\n",

A high-quality speech modification procedure STRAIGHT [1] extended to enable auditory morphing[2] was used for providing CD quality test stimuli. The test results indicated that naturalness of morphed speech samples were comparable to natural speech samples and resynthesized samples without any modifications when interpolated. It also indicated that the proposed morphing procedure enables to provide stimulus continuum between different emotional expressions. Partial morphing tests were also conducted to evaluate relative contributions and interdependence between spectral, temporal and source parameters.\n",

    "Short-time Fourier transform of speech signal has two components: magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum. In this paper, relative importance of short-time magnitude and phase spectra on speech perception is investigated. Human perception experiments are conducted to measure intelligibility of speech tokens synthesized either from magnitude spectrum or phase spectrum. It is traditionally believed that magnitude spectrum plays a dominant role for shorter windows (20-30 ms); while phase spectrum is more important for longer windows (128-3500 ms). It is shown in this paper that even for shorter windows, phase spectrum can contribute to speech intelligibility as much as the magnitude spectrum if the shape of the window function is properly selected.\n",

    "This study investigated the effect of duration and intensity on the perception of English lexical stress by native and non-native speakers of English. The spectral balance of intensity was manipulated in a \"realistic\" way suggested by Sluijter et al. [1], which is to increase intensity level in the higher frequency bands (above 500Hz) as shown in the realisation of vocal effort. A non-sense English word /n(textschwa):n(textschwa):/ embedded in a frame sentence was used as the stimuli of the perceptual experiment, where English speakers and two levels of Japanese learners of English (advanced and pre-intermediate) were asked to determine lexical stress locations. The result showed: (1) \"realistically\" manipulated intensity serves as a strong cue for lexical stress perception of English for all subject groups; (2) advanced Japanese learners of English are, like English speakers, sensitive to duration in lexical stress perception, whereas pre-intermediate Japanese learners are, to a very limited extent, duration-sensitive; and (3) intensity, if altered in a proper way, could be as significant a cue as duration in perceiving English lexical stress.\n",

    "This study investigates the correlations between physical and perceptual spaces of voiceless Japanese fricatives /f s (textesh) c h/, using Multidimensional Scaling technique. The spatial configurations were constructed from spectral distance measures and perceptual similarity judgements. The results show that 2-dimensional solutions adequately account for the data and the correlations between the two spaces are high. The dimensions also corresponded to `sibilance' and `place' properties. The spectral analyses on fricative sections, excluding the transitions, seem to contain sufficient information for correct perceptual judgements. These results are highly comparable to those of English fricative study (Choo, 1999), and support a universal prototype theory, according to which the correct identification of speech segments depends on the perceived distance between speech stimuli and a prototype in perceptual spaces.\n",

    "Speech Perception of humans begins to develop as young as 6- month-old or even earlier. The development of perception was suggested to be a self-organizing process driven by the linguistic environment to the infants [1]. Self-organizing maps have been widely used for modeling the perception development of infants [2]. However, in these models, temporal information within speech is ignored. Only single vowels or phones have little variations along time can be represented in this kind of models. In the present model, temporal information of speech can be captured by the self-feeding input preprocessors so that the sequence of speech components can be learnt by the self-organizing map. The acquisition of both the single vowels and diphthongs will be demonstrated in this paper.\n",

This spoken query data is supported by a second corpus which contains a record of subjects' viewing habits over a two year period.

    "The development of robots capable of accepting instructions in terms of familiar concepts to the user is still a challenge. For these robots to emerge it's essential the development of natural language interfaces, since this is regarded as the only interface acceptable for a machine which expected to have a high level of interactivity with Man. Our group has been involved for several years in the development of a mobile intelligent robot, named Carl, designed having in mind such tasks as serving food in a reception or acting as a host in an organization. The approach that has been followed in the design of Carl is based on an explicit concern with the integration of the major dimensions of intelligence, namely Communication, Action, Reasoning and Learning. This paper focuses on the multi-modal human-robot language communication capabilities of Carl, since these have been significantly improved during the last year.\n",

    "Designing speech interfaces is difficult. Research on spoken language systems and commercial application development has created a body of speech interface design knowledge. However, this knowledge is not easily accessible to practitioners. Few experts understand both speech recognition and human factors well enough to avoid the pitfalls of speech interface design. To facilitate the design of better speech interfaces, this paper presents a methodology to compile design guidelines for various classes of speech interfaces. Such guidelines enable practitioners to employ discount usability engineering methods to speech interfaces, including obtaining guidance during early stages of design, and heuristic evaluation. To illustrate our methodology, we apply it to generate a short list of ten guidelines for telephone spoken dialog systems. We demonstrate the usefulness of the guidelines with examples from our consulting practice, applying each guideline to improve poorly designed prompts. We believe this methodology can facilitate compiling the growing body of design knowledge to best practices for important classes of speech interfaces.\n",

It then uses speech recognition to convert the Arabic reply into Arabic text, and does information extraction on this text to find the answer content, which is rendered into English. A novel aspect of our work is its use of a statistical classifier to extract information content from the Arabic text.

Visual speech is synthesized by concatenating real image segments and speech segments selected from the database. In order to automatically perform all processes, e.g. feature extraction, segment selection and segment concatenation, we simply design two types of visual speech synthesis. One is synthesizing visual speech using synchronous real image and speech segments selected with only speech information. The other is using speech segment selection and image segment selection with features extracted from the database without processes by hand. We performed objective and subjective experiments to evaluate these designing methods. As a result, the latter method can synthesize visual speech more naturally than the former method.\n",

    "This study investigated the effectiveness of Baldi for teaching non-native phonetic contrasts, by comparing instruction illustrating the internal articulatory processes of the oral cavity versus instruction providing just the normal view of the tutor's face. Eleven Japanese speakers of English as a second language were bimodally trained under both instruction methods to identify and produce American English /r/ and /l/ in a within-subject design. Speech identification and production improved under both training methods although training with a view of the internal articulators did not show an additional benefit. A generalization test showed that this learning transferred to the production of new words.\n",

    "One of the best challenges in Lip Reading is to apply this technology to an embedded device. In the current solutions the high use of resources, especially in reference to visual processing, makes the implementation in a small device very difficult. In this article a new, efficient and straightforward algorithm for detection and tracking of lips is presented. Lip Finding and Tracking is the first step in visual processing for Lip Reading. In our approach the Lip Finding is performed between a small amount of blobs, which should fulfill a geometric restriction. In terms of computational power and memory the proposed algorithm meets the requirements of an embedded device; on average less than 4 MHz^1 of CPU is required. This algorithm shows promising results in a realistic environment accomplishing successful lip finding and tracking in 94.2% of more than 4900 image frames.\n",

During interpretation of speech, visual context seems to steer speech processing and vice versa. We present a real-time multimodal system motivated by these findings that performs early integration of visual contextual information to recognize the most likely word sequences in spoken language utterances. The system first acquires a grammar and a visually grounded lexicon from a \"show-and-tell\" procedure where the training input consists of camera images consisting of sets of objects paired with verbal object descriptions. Given a new scene, the system generates a dynamic visually-grounded language model and drives a dynamic model of visual attention to steer speech recognition search paths towards more likely word sequences.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a new formulation of the classical Good-Turing estimator for n-gram language model. The new approach is based on defining a dynamic model for language production. Instead of assuming a fixed probability distribution of occurrence of an n-gram on the whole text, we propose a maximum entropy approximation of a time varying distribution. This approximation led us to a new distribution, which in turn is used to calculate expectations of the Good-Turing estimator. This defines a new estimator that we call Maximum Entropy Good-Turing estimator. Contrary to the classical Good-Turing estimator it needs neither expectations approximations nor windowing or other smoothing techniques. It also contains the well know discounting estimators as special cases. Performance is evaluated both in terms of perplexity and word error rate in an N-best re-scoring task. Also comparison to other classical estimators is performed. In all cases our approach performs significantly better than classical estimators.\n",

In this paper we propose to exploit the order-preserving (OP) property of a string-key based MPH function to further reduce hashing operation and speed up LM lookahead. A subtree structure is proposed for LM lookahead and an order-preserving MPH is integrated into the structure design. Subtrees are generated on demand and stored in caches. Experiments were performed on Switchboard data. By using the proposed method of OP MPH and subtree cache structure for both trigrams and backoff bigrams, the LM lookahead time was reduced by a factor of 2.9 in comparison with the baseline case of using MPH alone.\n",

The perplexity and speech recognition experiments on Finnish speech data show that the resulting model outperforms both word and syllable based trigram models.

    "In this article we evaluate our stochastic morphosyntactic language model (SMLM) on a Hungarian newspaper dictation task that requires modeling over 1 million different word forms. The proposed method is based on the use of morphemes as the basic recognition units and the combination of a morpheme N-gram model and a morphosyntactic language model. The architecture of the recognition system is based on the weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) paradigm. Thanks to the flexible transducer-based architecture, the morphosyntactic component is integrated seamlessly with the basic modules with no need to modify the decoder itself. We compare the phoneme, morpheme, and word error-rates as well as the sizes of the recognition networks in two configurations. In one configuration we use only the N-gram model while in the other we use the combined model. The proposed stochastic morphosyntactic language model decreases the morpheme error rate by between 1.7 and 7.2% relatively when compared to the baseline trigram system. The morpheme error-rate of the best configuration is 18% and the best word error-rate is 22.3%.\n",

It is important for browsing and retrieving spoken documents, which may be automatically transcribed, but it will be much more helpful if given the titles indicating the content subjects of the documents. On the other hand, the Chinese language is not only spoken by the largest population of the world, but with very special structure different from western languages. It is not alphabetic, with large number of distinct characters each pronounced as a monosyllable, while the total number of syllables is limited. In this paper, considering the special structure of the Chinese language, a set of \"feature units\" for Chinese spoken language processing is defined and the effects of the choice of these \"feature units\" on automatic title generation are analyzed with a new adaptive K nearest-neighbor approach, proposed in a companion paper also submitted to this conference as the baseline.\n",

Many approaches to S2S translation have been proposed continually. Among of them, corpus-dependent statistical strategies have been widely studied during recent years. In corpus-based translation methodology, rather than taking the corpus just as reference templates, more detailed or structural information should be exploited and integrated in statistical modeling. Under the statistical translation framework that provides very flexible way of integrating different prior or structural knowledge, we have conducted a series of R&D activities on S2S translation. In the most recent version, we have independently developed a prototype Chinese-English bi-directional S2S translation system with the supports of multilingual speech recognition and bilingual-Chunk based statistical translation techniques to meet the demand of Manos - a multilingual information service project for 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

    "In language communication, an utterance may be segmented as a concatenation of chunks that are reasonable in syntax, meaningful in semantics, and composed of several words. Usually, the order of words within chunks is fixed, and the order of chunks within an utterance is rather flexible. The improvement of spoken language translation could benefit from using bilingual chunks. This paper presents a statistical algorithm to build the bilingual chunk-lexicon automatically from spoken language corpora. Several association measurements are set up as the criteria of the extraction. And local best algorithm, length ratio filtration and stop-word filtration are also incorporated to improve the performance. A bilingual chunk-lexicon was extracted from a corpus with precision of 86.0% and recall of 86.7%. The usability of the chunk-lexicon was then tested with an innovative framework for English-to-Chinese Spoken Language translation, resulted in translation accuracy of 81.83% and 78.69% for training and test sets respectively, measured with Levenshtein distance based similarity score.\n",

    "This paper presents the application of document expansion using a side collection to a cross-language spoken document retrieval (CL-SDR) task to improve retrieval performance. Document expansion is applied to a series of English-Mandarin CL-SDR experiments using selected retrieval models (probabilistic belief network, vector space model, and HMM-based retrieval model). English textual queries are used to retrieve relevant documents from an archive of Mandarin radio broadcast news. We have devised a multi-scale approach for document expansion - a process that enriches the Mandarin spoken document collection in order to improve overall retrieval performance. A document is expanded by (i) first retrieving related documents on a character bigram scale, (ii) then extracting word units from such related documents as expansion terms to augment the original document and (iii) finally indexing all documents in the collection by means of character bigrams and those expanded terms by within-word character bigrams to prepare for future retrieval. Hence the document expansion approach is multi-scale as it involves both word and subword scales. Experimental results show that this approach achieves performance improvements up to 14% across several retrieval models.\n",

    "From the perspective of speech technology development for unlimited Mandarin Chinese TTS, two issues appear most impedimental: (1.) how to predict prosody from text, and (2.) how to achieve better naturalness for speech output. These impediments somewhat brought out the major pitfalls in related research, i.e., characteristics of Chinese connected speech and the overall rhythmic structure of speech flow. This paper discusses where the problems stem from and how some solutions could be found. We propose that for Mandarin, prosody research needs to include the following: (1.) characteristics of Mandarin connected speech that constitute the prosodic properties in speech flow, i.e., units and boundaries, (2.) scope and type of speech data collected, i.e., text other than isolated sentences, (3.) prosody in relation to speech planning, i.e., information other than lexical, syntactic and semantic, and (4.) an overall organization of prosody for speech flow, i.e., a framework that accommodate the above mentioned features.\n",

The heavier the accent is, the more frequently the mispronunciation occurs. Initials present more modifications than finals. Nine vowels are also compared phonetically for 10 Standard Chinese speakers and 10 Shanghai speakers with middle-class accent. Additionally, retroflexed finals occur more than 10 times in Standard Chinese. No significant difference exists on durations of initials and finals for these 20 speakers. And no phonological difference is found on four lexical tones. It seems that the prosodic difference is mainly on rhythmic or stress pattern.\n",

    "Emotional speech analysis was normally conducted from the viewpoint of prosody and articulation features. But for emotional speech synthesis system, two issues appear most important: (1) how to realize the acoustic features among various emotion states? (2) how to convey the emotion with the combination of text analysis and environment detection. To answer the two questions, both acoustic features and emotion focus were analyzed in the paper. Due to the different background and culture, even the same emotion has different meaning for different people in certain contexts. The paper also tries to explain if there are special characters in Chinese emotion expression. Finally, the emotion controlling model is described in the paper, some rules are listed in a table. Environment influence was also classified and integrated into the system. At the end of paper, the emotion synthesis results were evaluated and compared to other previous works.\n",

    "We consider the system of articulators \"jaw - tip of the tongue\" in order to investigate instant and integral optimality criteria in the variational approach to the solution of speech inverse problem \"from total displacement of articulators to their controls\". The required experimental data i.e., coordinates of the tip of the tongue and lower incisor have been measured by the use of the X-ray microbeam system together with EMGs of masseter, longitudinalis superior and longitudinalis inferior. These data have been registered for sequences of syllable /ta/ with different articulation rates, as well as for an elevation and lowering of the tongue tip in non-speech mode. We analyze instant and integral criteria of the work, kinetic energy, elastic and inertial forces for the system. In speech mode, total displacements of the tongue tip and the jaw are simulated perfectly by the use of any instant and integral criterion, mentioned above. At the same time, the own displacements of the tongue tip and the jaw are reproduced well by means of integral criteria only. On the contrary, the own displacements in non-speech mode are reproduced satisfactory only by the use of any instant optimality criterion.\n",

    "Physiological models of the speech organs must consider cocontraction of the muscles, a common phenomenon taking place during articulation. This study investigated cocontraction of the tongue muscles using the physiological articulatory model that replicates midsagittal regions of the speech organs to simulate articulatory movements during speech [1,2]. The relation between the muscle force and tongue movement obtained by the model simulation indicated that each muscle drives the tongue towards an equilibrium position (EP) corresponding to the magnitude of the activation forces. Contributions of the muscles to the tongue movement were evaluated by the distance between the equilibrium positions. Based on the EPs and the muscle contributions, an invariant mapping (the EP map) was established to function the connection of a spatial location to a muscle force. Cocontractions between agonist and antagonist muscles were simulated using the EP maps. The simulations demonstrated that coarticulation with multiple targets could be compatibly realized using the co-contraction mechanism. The implementation of the co-contraction mechanism enables relatively independent control over the tongue tip and body.\n",

The parameters of these extended tube elements can be fitted to experimental and theoretical data of the loss effects of wall vibrations, viscosity and heat conduction. For the analysis of speech sounds the parameters of a lossy vocal tract model are estimated from speech signals by an optimization algorithm. The spectrum of the analyzed speech can be approximated well by the estimated magnitude response of the lossy vocal tract model.

The long-term prediction is performed forward and backward. The minimum of the forward and backward prediction error is a cue of vocal noise. The minimum backward and forward prediction error has been calculated for corpora involving connected speech and sustained vowels. Comparisons have been performed between the estimated vocal noise and the perceived hoarseness in steady vowel fragments, as well as between the estimated vocal noise in connected speech and sustained vowels produced by the same speakers.\n",

    "A system for visualisation of the vocal-tract shapes during vowel articulation has been designed and developed. The system generates the vocal tract configuration using a new approach based on extracting both the area functions and the formant frequencies form the acoustic speech signal. Using a linear prediction analysis, the vocal tract area functions and the first three formants are first estimated. The estimated area functions are then mapped to corresponding mid-sagittal distances and displayed as 2D vocal tract lateral graphics. The mapping process is based on a simple numerical algorithm and an accurate reference grid derived from x-rays for the pronunciation of a number English vowels uttered by different speakers. To compensate for possible errors in the estimated area functions due to variations in vocal tract length, the first two section distances are determined by the three formants. The formants are also used to adjust the rounding of the lips and the height of the jawbone. Results show high correlation with x-ray data and the PARAFAC analysis. The system could be useful as a visual sensory aid for speech training of the hearing-impaired.\n",

Formant parameters are derived from the coefficients of a linear prediction (LP) model of speech. The formant distributions are modelled with phoneme-dependent two-dimensional hidden Markov models with state Gaussian mixture densities. The HMMs are subsequently used for re-estimation of the formant trajectories of speech. Two alternative methods are explored for voice morphing. The first is a non-uniform frequency warping method and the second is based on spectral mapping via rotation of the formant vectors of the source towards those of the target. Both methods transform all formant parameters (Frequency, Bandwidth and Intensity). In addition, the factors that affect the selection of the warping ratios for the mapping function are presented.

In this paper, STRAIGHT analysis-synthesis framework is used to improve the quality. A smoothed GMM and MAP adaptation is proposed for spectrum conversion to avoid the overly smooth phenomenon in the traditional GMM method. Since frames are processed independently, the GMM based transformation function may generate discontinuous features. Therefore, a time domain low pass filter is applied on the transformation function during the conversion phase. The results of listening evaluations show that the quality of the speech converted by the proposed method is significantly better than that by the traditional GMM method. Meanwhile, speaker identifiability of the converted voice reaches 75%, even when the difference between the source speaker and the target speaker is not very large.\n",

    "This paper proposes a new voice conversion algorithm that modifies the source speaker's speech to sound as if produced by a target speaker. To date, most approaches for speaker transformation are based on mapping functions or codebooks. We propose a linear filtering based approach to the problem of mapping the spectral parameters of one speaker to those of the other. In the proposed method, the transformation is performed by filtering the source speaker's Line Spectral Pair (LSP) frequencies to obtain the LSP frequency estimates of the target speaker. Speech signal is time-aligned into a sequence of HMM states. The filters are designed for each HMM state using the aligned data. We consider two methods for spectral conversion. A linear transformation for the LSP's was obtained using the adaptive steepest gradient descent approach. Mean values of LSP's are adjusted to match those of the target speaker. In order to prevent the LSP vectors from resulting in unstable vocal tract filters, weighted least square estimation is used. This approach optimizes differences between source and target LSP's. Weights are inverses of the source LSP variances. This approach is integrated into a Time Domain Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add (TD-PSOLA) analysis-synthesis framework. The algorithm is objectively evaluated using a distance measure based on the log-likelihood ratio of observing the input speech, given Gaussian mixture speaker models for both the source and the target voice. Results using the Gaussian mixture model formulated criteria demonstrate consistent transformation using a 5 speaker database. The algorithm offers promise for rapidly adapting text-to-speech systems to new voices.\n",

    "A speaker conversion framework for formant synthesis is proposed. With this framework, given a small set of a target speaker's utterances, segmental features of an original speech can be converted to those of the given speaker. Unlike other speaker conversion frameworks, further voice quality modification can also be applied to the converted speech with conventional formant modification techniques. The parameter conversion is based on MLLR in the cepstral domain. The effect of parameter conversion can be seen from the graphical representation of formant placement. The results of an auditory experiment showed that most of the converted speech was perceived as being similar to that of target speakers.\n",

    "The W3C Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) unifies a number of recent related markup languages that have emerged to fill the perceived need for increased, and standardized, user control over Text to Speech (TTS) engines. One of the main drivers for markup has been the increasing use of TTS engines as embedded components of specific applications - which means they are in a position to take advantage of additional knowledge about the text. Although SSML allows improved control over the text normalization process, most of the attention has focused on the level of prosody markup, especially since the prediction of the prosody is generally acknowledged as one of the most significant problems in TTS synthesis. Prosody control is by no means simple due to the large cross-dependency between other related aspects of prosody. Prosody control is also of particular complexity for concatenative TTS systems. SSML is about much more than prosody control though - allowing high level engine control such as language switching and voice switching, and low level control such as phonetic input for words. Our experiences in implementing these diverse requirements of the SSML standard are discussed.\n",

    "The focus effects on acoustic correlates include both prosodic and segmental modifications. Analysis of 35 focused words in a carrier sentences uttered by 2 male and 3 female speakers has shown that: (1) there is a significant asymmetry of vowel duration as well as F0 range between the pre-stressed and post-stressed syllables, implying that different strategies are employed in the task of focusing disyllabic words, i.e., emphasizing the first syllable as well as weakening the second syllable for the former, but emphasizing the second syllable only for the latter; (2) the tonal combinations significantly affect the variations of both the vowel duration and F0 range; (3) the formant frequencies (F1, F2) are changed systematically in a way that that the formants of the vowels plotted in the (F1, F2) plane were stretched outwards. Perceptual validation of the relative importance of these acoustic cues for signaling a focal word has been accomplished. Results of the perception experiment indicate that F0 is the dominant cue closely related to the judgment of focused word and the other two cues, duration and formant frequencies contribute less to the judgment.\n",

The cost function leads to a matrix formulation of the error for two time intervals where the error must be defined. This defines a framework that facilitates to model the phases associated to consecutive periods. We give a matrix formulation of the estimation process that let us to attain two main objectives. Firstly, estimate the common-pole structure of several consecutive periods and their particular zero structure. And secondly, estimate their common-pole-zero structure.

First, we point out and correct a long-standing sign error in some literature related to the derivation of the acoustic reflection coefficients of the vocal tract from a speech signal. Next, to eliminate the influence of the glottal wave on the estimation of the vocal-tract filter, we estimate the vocal-tract filter and the derivative of the glottal wave simultaneously from a speech signal. From the vocal-tract filter obtained, we derive the vocal-tract area function. Our improvements to existing methods can be seen from the vocal-tract area functions obtained for vowel sounds /(textscripta)/ and /i/, each produced by a female and a male subject. They are comparable with those obtained using the magnetic resonance imaging method. The derivatives of the glottal waves for these sounds are also presented, and they show very detailed structures.\n",

    "In this paper, a glottal event synchronous sinusoidal model is proposed. A glottal event corresponds to the glottal closure instant (GCI), which is accurately estimated using group delay and fixed point analysis in the time domain using energy centroids. The GCI synchronous sinusoidal model allows adequate processing according to the inherent local properties of speech, resulting in phase matching between adjacent and corresponding harmonics that are essential for precise speech analysis. Frequency domain fixed points from mapping filter center frequencies to the instantaneous frequencies of the filter outputs result in highly accurate estimates of the constituent sinusoidal components. Adequate window selection and placement at the GCI is found to be important in obtaining stable sinusoidal components. We demonstrate that the GCI synchronous instantaneous frequency method allows a large reduction in spurious peaks in the spectrum and enables high quality synthesised speech. In speech quality evaluations, glottal synchronous analysis-synthesis results in a 0.4 improvement in MOS over conventional fixed frame rate analysis-synthesis.\n",

    "The authors propose a framework for audiovisual speech synthesis systems [1] and present a first implementation of the framework [2], which is called MASSY - Modular Audiovisual Speech SYnthesizer. This paper describes how the audiovisual speech synthesis system, the `talking head', works, how it can be integrated into web-applications, and why it is worthwhile using it. The presented applications use the wrapped audio synthesis, the phonetic and visual articulation modules, and a face module. One of the two already implemented visual articulation models, based on a dominance model for coarticulation, is used. The face is a 3D model described in VRML 97. The facial animation is described in a motion parameter model which is capable of realizing the most important visible articulation gestures [3][4]. MASSY is developed in the client-server paradigm. The server is easy to set up and does not need special or high performance hardware. The required bandwidth is low, and the client is an ordinary web browser with a freely available standard plug-in. The system is used for the evaluation of measured and predicted articulation models and is also suitable for the enhancement of human-computer-interfaces in applications like e.g. virtual tutors in e-learning environments, speech training, video conferencing, computer games, audiovisual information systems, virtual agents, and many more.\n",

    "The first \"speaking machine\" of the world was created by the Hungarian polyhistor Farkas Kempelen. He can also be referred to as the first phonetician in the world. He went on improving his speaking machine for twenty-two years, and described the final version in a book published in 1791 in Vienna. The reconstruction was made based on this book. What we wanted to make was not just an exhibition piece but a machine that actually worked. Thus we can go back more than 200 years and study the working of one of the most precious instruments of the Baroque period. We can try out the ways of producing sounds that Kempelen wrote so many pages about in his book. The acoustic patterns of the machine's speech can be studied by today's sophisticated signal processing methods and prove or disprove Kempelen's claims by measurement data. Besides these we took it to be an important task in terms of the history of science to contribute to our knowledge of the beginnings of phonetic research.\n",

    "This paper presents an approach to realizing various emotional expressions and speaking styles in synthetic speech using HMM-based speech synthesis. We show two methods for modeling speaking styles and emotions. In the first method, called \"style dependent modeling,\" each speaking style and emotion is individually modeled. On the other hand, in the second method, called \"style mixed modeling,\" speaking style or emotion is treated as a contextual factor as well as phonetic, prosodic, and linguistic factors, and all speaking styles and emotions are modeled by a single acoustic model simultaneously. We chose four styles, that is, \"reading,\" \"rough,\" \"joyful,\" and \"sad,\" and compared those two modeling methods using these styles. From the results of subjective tests, it is shown that both modeling methods have almost the same performance, and that it is possible to synthesize speech with similar speaking styles and emotions to those of the recorded speech. In addition, it is also shown that the style mixed modeling can reduce the number of output distributions in comparison with the style dependent modeling.\n",

    "This paper describes a technique which improves the accuracy of pronunciation prediction for unit selection TTS. It does this by performing an orthography-based context-dependent lookup on the unit database. During synthesis, the pronunciations of words which have matching contexts in the unit database are determined. Pronunciations not found using this method are determined using traditional lexicon lookup and/or letter-to-sound rules. In its simplest form, the model involves a lookup based on left and right word context. A modified form, which backs-off to a lookup based on right context, is shown to have a much higher firing rate, and to produce more pronunciation variation. The technique is good at occasionally inhibiting vowel reduction; at choosing appropriate pronunciations in case of free variation; and at choosing the correct pronunciation for names. Its effectiveness is assessed by experiments on unseen data; by resynthesis; and by a listening test on sentences rich in reducible words.\n",

Finally, scalar quantization is performed for the mean components of the models. With the proposed method, a memory saving of 77.6% was achieved compared with the original continuous density HMMs and 23.0% compared to the quantized parameter HMMs, respectively.

    "Most automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems use Hidden Markov model (HMM) with a diagonal-covariance Gaussian mixture model for the state-conditional probability density function. The diagonal-covariance Gaussian mixture can model discrete sources of variability like speaker variations, gender variations, or local dialect, but can not model continuous types of variability that account for correlation between the elements of the feature vector. In this paper, we present a transformation of the acoustic feature vector that minimizes an empirical estimate of the relative entropy between the likelihood based on the diagonal-covariance Gaussian mixture HMM model and the true likelihood. Based on this formulation, we provide a solution to the problem using volume-preserving maps; existing linear feature transform designs are shown to be special cases of the proposed solution. Since most of the acoustic features used in ASR are not linear functions of the sources of correlation in the speech signal, we use a non-linear transformation of the features to minimize this objective function. We describe an iterative algorithm to estimate the parameters of both the volume-preserving feature transformation and the HMM that jointly optimize the objective function for an HMM-based speech recognizer. Using this algorithm, we achieved 2% improvement in phoneme recognition accuracy compared to the baseline system. Our approach shows also improvement in recognition accuracy compared to previous linear approaches like linear discriminant analysis (LDA), maximum likelihood linear transform (MLLT), and independent component analysis (ICA).\n",

    "A Speech and Character Combined Recognition System (SCCRS) is developed for working on PDA (Personal Digital Assistants) or on mobile devices. In SCCRS, feature extraction for speech and for character is carried out separately, but recognition is performed in an engine. The recognition engine employs essentially CHMM (Continuous Hidden Markov Model) structure and this CHMM consists of variable parameter topology in order to minimize the number of model parameters and to reduce recognition time. This model also adopts our proposed SSMS (Successive State and Mixture Splitting) for generating context independent model. SSMS optimizes the number of mixtures through splitting in mixture domain and the number of states through splitting in time domain. The recognition results show that the proposed SSMS method can reduce the total number of Gaussian up to 40.0% compared with the fixed parameter models at the same recognition performance in speech recognition system.\n",

The phonetic broad classes are used by tree based clustering procedure for node questions during the context dependent acoustic models generation for speech recognition. The data driven approach is based on phoneme confusion matrix, which is produced with the phoneme recogniser. Such approach enables the data driven method independency from particular language or phoneme set found in a database. Data driven broad classes generated with this method were compared to expert defined and randomly generated broad classes. The experiment was carried out with the Slovenian SpeechDat(II) database. Six different test configurations were included in the evaluation. Analysis of speech recognition results for different acoustic models showed that the proposed data driven method gives comparable or better results than standard method.\n",

    "This paper discusses building gender dependent gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and how to integrate these with an efficient gender detection scheme. Gender specific acoustic models of half the size of a corresponding gender independent acoustic model substantially outperform the larger gender independent acoustic models. With perfect gender detection, gender dependent modeling should therefore yield higher recognition accuracy without consuming more memory. Furthermore, as certain phonemes are inherently gender independent (e.g. silence) much of the male and female specific acoustic models can be shared. This paper proposes how to discover which phonemes are inherently similar for male and female speakers and how to efficiently share this information between gender dependent GMMs. A highly accurate and computationally efficient gender detection scheme is suggested that takes advantage of computations inherently done in the speech recognizer. By making the gender assignment probabilistic an increase in word error rate (WER) seen for erroneously gender labeled speakers is avoided. The method of gender detection and probabilistic use of gender is novel and should be of interest beyond mere gender detection. The only requirement for the method to work is that the training data be appropriately labeled.\n",

    "We study on a syllable-based acoustic modeling method for Japanese spontaneous speech recognition. Traditionally, mora-based acoustic models have been adopted for Japanese read speech recognition systems. In this paper, syllable-based unit and mora-based unit are clearly distinguished in their definition, and syllables are shown to be more suitable as an acoustic model for Japanese spontaneous speech recognition. In spontaneous speech, a vowel lengthening occurs frequently, and recognition accuracy is greatly affected by this phenomena. From this viewpoint, we propose an acoustic modeling technique that explicitly incorporates the vowel lengthening in syllable-based HMMs. Experimental results showed that the proposed model could exceed the performance of conventionally used cross-word triphone model and mora-based model in Japanese spontaneous speech recognition task.\n",

    "This paper concerns about reducing the topology of a hidden Markov model (HMM) for a given task. The purpose is two-fold: (1) to select a good model topology with improved generalization capability; and/or (2) to reduce the model complexity so as to save memory and computation costs. The first goal falls into the active research area of model selection. From the model-theoretic research community, various measures such as Bayesian information criterion, minimum description length, minimum message length have been proposed and used with some success. In this paper, we are considering another approach in which a well-performed HMM, though perhaps oversized, is optimally pruned so that the loss in the model training cost function is minimal. The method is known as Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) that has been used in the neural network (NN) community. The application of OBS to NN is a constrained optimization problem; its application to HMM is more involved and it becomes a quadratic programming problem with both equality and inequality constraints. The detailed formulation is presented, and the algorithm is shown effective by an example in which HMM state transitions are pruned. The reduced model also results in better generalization performance on unseen test data.\n",

We present a class of DBN-based hidden feature models, and show that such a representation can be not only more expressive but also more parsimonious. We also describe a way of representing the acoustic observation model with fewer distributions using a product of models, each corresponding to a subset of the features.

    "DBNs (Dynamic Bayesian Networks) [1] are powerful tool in modeling time-series data, and have been used in speech recognition recently [2,3,4]. The \"decoding\" task in speech recognition means to find the viterbi path [5](in graphical model community, \"viterbi path\" has the same meaning as MPE \"Most Probable Explanation\") for a given acoustic observations. In this paper we describe a new algorithm utilizes a new data structure \"backpointer\", which is produced in the \"marginalization\" procedure in probability inference. With these backpointers, the viterbi path can be found in a simple backtracking. We first introduce the concept of backpointer and backtracking; then give the algorithm to compute the viterbi path for DBNs based on backpointer and backtracking. We prove that the new algorithm is correct, faster and more memory saving comparison with old algorithm. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on several well known DBNs. We also test the algorithm on a real world DBN model that can recognize continuous digit numbers.\n",

They can also be re-parameterized as exponential models with canonical parameters P = (Sigma) ^-1 and (psi) = P(mu). In this paper we consider modeling acoustics with mixtures of Gaussians parameterized with canonical parameters where the parameters are constrained to lie in a shared affine subspace. This class of models includes Gaussian models with various constraints on its parameters: diagonal covariances, MLLT models, and the recently proposed EMLLT and SPAM models. We describe how to perform maximum likelihood estimation of the subspace and parameters within a fixed subspace. In speech recognition experiments, we show that this model improves upon all of the above classes of models with roughly the same number of parameters and with little computational overhead. In particular we get 30-40% relative improvement over LDA+MLLT models when using roughly the same number of parameters.\n",

It has been shown to yield significant error rate improvements over other methods of constraining covariances such as diagonal, semi-tied covariances, and extended maximum likelihood linear transformations. In this paper we address the problem of discriminative estimation of SPAM model parameters, in an attempt to further improve its performance. We present discriminative estimation under two criteria: maximum mutual information (MMI) and an \"error-weighted\" training. We show that both these methods individually result in over 20% relative reduction in word error rate on a digit task over maximum likelihood (ML) estimated SPAM model parameters. We also show that a gain of as much as 28% relative can be achieved by combining these two discriminative estimation techniques.

    "Speech recognition technology has been widely used. Considering a training cost of an acoustic model, it is beneficial to reuse pre-existing acoustic models for making a suitable one for various apparatus and application. However, a complex acoustic model for high CPU power does not work for low CPU power. And a simple model for fast-processing-demanded application does not work well for high-precision-demanded ones. Therefore, it is important to adjust a model complexity according to apparatus or application, such as a number of mixture of Gaussians. This paper describes a new model-integration-type of training for obtaining a required number of mixture of Gaussians. This training can alter a number of mixture into a required one according to a specification of apparatus or application. We propose a model integration rapid training based on maximum likelihood, and evaluate the recognition performance successfully.\n",

    "This paper describes an approach for feature extraction in speech recognition systems using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). This approach consists in representing speech features as the projection of the extracted speech features mapped into a feature space via a nonlinear mapping onto the principal components. The nonlinear mapping is implicitly performed using the kernel-trick, which is an useful way of not mapping the input space into a feature space explicitly, making this mapping computationally feasible. Better results were obtained by using this approach when compared to the standard technique.\n",

    "Speech recognition often involves the face-to-face communication between two or more individuals. The combined influences of auditory and visual speech information leads to a remarkably robust signal that is greatly resistant to noise, reverberation, hearing loss, and other forms of signal distortion. Studies of auditory-visual speech processing have revealed that speechreading interacts with audition in both the spectral and temporal domain. For example, not all speech frequencies are equal in their ability to supplement speechreading, with low-frequency speech cues providing more benefit than high-frequency speech cues. Additionally, in contrast to auditory speech processing which integrates information across frequency over relatively short time windows (20- 40 ms), auditory-visual speech processing appears to use relatively long time windows of integration (roughly 250 ms). In this paper, some of the basic spectral and temporal interactions between auditory and visual speech channels are enumerated and discussed.\n",

    "Psychophysical research has established that temporal-integration windows of several different sizes are critical for the analysis of any acoustic speech signal. Recent work from our laboratory has examined speech processing in the human auditory cortex using both hemodynamic (fMRI, PET) and electromagnetic (MEG, EEG) recording techniques. These studies provide evidence for at least two distinct temporal scales relevant to the integration and processing of speech at the cortical level - a relatively short window of 25-50 ms and a longer window of 150- 300 ms. In addition to support for processing on these time scales, there is also evidence for hemispheric asymmetry in temporal quantization. Left auditory cortex shows enhanced sensitivity to rapid temporal changes (possibly associated with segmental and subsegmental perceptual analysis), while right auditory cortex is more sensitive to slower changes (possibly associated with syllabic rate processing and dynamics of pitch).\n",

These developments are focused on the shaping and relative timing of gestural activations, and on the manner in which relative timing among gestures can be interpreted and modeled in the context of systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators. Emphasis is placed on dynamical accounts of prosodic boundary influences on gestural activation patterns, and the manner in which intergestural coupling structures shape the timing patterns and stability properties of onset and coda clusters.\n",

    "The simulation of speech by means of speech synthesis involves, among other things, the ability to mimic typical delivery for different speech styles. This requires a realistic imitation of the manner in which speakers organize their information flow in time (i.e., word grouping boundaries), as well their speech rate with its variations. The originality of our model is grounded in two levels. First, it is assumed that the temporal component plays a dominant role in the simulation of speech rhythm, whereas in traditional language models, temporal issues are mostly put aside. Second, the outcome of our temporal modeling, based on statistical analysis and qualitative parameters, results from the harmonization of various layers (segmental, syllabic, phrasal). The benefit of a multidimensional model is the possibility of imposing subtle quantitative and qualitative effects at various levels, which is a key for respecting a specific language system as well as speech coherence and fluency for different speech styles.\n",

    "Recent auditory physiological evidence points to a modulation frequency dimension in the auditory cortex. This dimension exists jointly with the tonotopic acoustic frequency dimension. Thus, audition can be considered as a relatively slowly-varying two-dimensional representation, the \"modulation spectrum,\" where the first dimension is the well-known acoustic frequency and the second dimension is modulation frequency. We have recently developed a fully invertible analysis/synthesis approach for this modulation spectral transform. A general application of this approach is removal or modification of different modulation frequencies in audio or speech signals, which, for example, causes major changes in perceived dynamic character. A specific application of this modification is single-channel multiple-talker separation.\n",

    "Since the introduction of hidden Markov modelling there has been an increasing emphasis on data-driven approaches to automatic speech recognition. This derives from the fact that systems trained on substantial corpora readily outperform those that rely on more phonetic or linguistic priors. Similarly, extra training data almost always results in a reduction in word error rate - \"there's no data like more data\". However, despite this progress, contemporary systems are not able to fulfill the requirements demanded by many potential applications, and performance is still significantly short of the capabilities exhibited by human listeners. For these reasons, the R&D community continues to call for even greater quantities of data in order to train their systems. This paper addresses the issue of just how much data might be required in order to bring the performance of an automatic speech recognition system up to that of a human listener.\n",

    "This paper explores a new approach to speech recognition in which sub-word units are modeled in terms of linguistic features. Specifically, we have adopted a scheme of modeling separately the manner and place of articulation for these units. A novelty of our work is the use of a generalized definition of place of articulation that enables us to map both vowels and consonants into a common linguistic space. Modeling manner and place separately also allows us to explore a multi-stage recognition architecture, in which the search space is successively reduced as more detailed models are brought in. In the 8,000 word PhoneBook isolated word telephone speech recognition task, we show that such an approach can achieve a recognition WER that is 10% better than that achieved in the best results reported in the literature. This performance gain comes with improvements in search space and computation time as well.\n",

    "This paper addresses the influence of audio segmentation and segment clustering on automatic transcription accuracy for large spoken archives. The work forms part of the ongoing MALACH project, which is developing advanced techniques for supporting access to the world's largest digital archive of video oral histories collected in many languages from over 52000 survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust. We present several audio-only and audio-visual segmentation schemes, including two novel schemes: the first is iterative and audio-only, the second uses audio-visual synchrony. Unlike most previous work, we evaluate these schemes in terms of their impact upon recognition accuracy. Results on English interviews show the automatic segmentation schemes give performance comparable to (exorbitantly expensive and impractically lengthy) manual segmentation when using a single pass decoding strategy based on speaker-independent models. However, when using a multiple pass decoding strategy with adaptation, results are sensitive to both initial audio segmentation and the scheme for clustering segments prior to adaptation: the combination of our best automatic segmentation and clustering scheme has an error rate 8% worse (relative) to manual audio segmentation and clustering due to the occurrence of \"speaker-impure\" segments.\n",

    "In this paper, two techniques are proposed to enhance the non-native (Japanese English) speech recognition performance. The first technique effectively integrates orthographic representation of a phoneme as an additional context in state clustering in training tied-state triphones. Non-native speakers often learned the target language not through their ears but through their eyes and it is easily assumed that their pronunciation of a phoneme may depend upon its grapheme. Here, correspondence between a vowel and its grapheme is automatically extracted and used as an additional context in the state clustering. The second technique elaborately couples a Japanese English acoustic model and a Japanese Japanese model to make a parallel model. When using triphones, mapping between the two models should be carefully trained because phoneme sets of both the models are different. Here, several phoneme recognition experiments are done to induce the mapping, and based upon the mapping, a tentative method of the coupling is examined. Results of LVCSR experiments show high validity of both the proposed methods.\n",

We developed a microphone attachment, which adheres to the skin, applying the principle of a medical stethoscope, found the ideal position for sampling flesh-conducted NAM sound vibration and retrained an acoustic model with NAM samples. Then using the Julius Japanese Dictation Toolkit, we tested the possibilities for practical use of this method in place of an external microphone for analyzing air-conducted voice sound. Additionally we propose laryngeal elevation index (LEI), a new index of prosody, which can show the prosody of NAM without F0, using simple processing of images from medical ultrasonography. We realized and defined NAM never used for input or communication and propose that we should make use of it for the interface of human-human and human-cybernetic machines.\n",

    "One problem with using speaker identification by witnesses in legal settings is that high quality imitations can result in speaker misidentification. A recent series of experiments has looked at listener acceptance of an imitation of a well known Swedish politician. Results showed that listener expectation of the topic of an imitated passage impacts on the acceptance or rejection of the imitation. The strength of that impact varied according to various listener characteristics, including age of listener. It is likely that age reflected the degree of familiarity with the voice that was being imitated. The present study has reanalyzed the data from Swedish listeners in the previous studies to look at performance according to self reports of whether the listeners were familiar with the politician. Results showed that the acceptance of the imitation by those listeners who reported knowing the politician was more influenced by the topic of the imitated passage than by those who reported not knowing him. Implications of this finding in regard to listeners' choice of alternate voices in the line up are discussed.\n",

In this paper, substantial improvements with regard to that reference architecture are described. Firstly, a new heuristic method for selecting the impostors in the ANN training process is presented, eliminating the random nature of the system behaviour introduced by the traditional random selection. The use of the proposed selection method, together with an improvement in the classification stage based on a selective use of the network outputs to calculate the final sample score, and an optimisation of the MLP learning coefficient, allow an improvement of over 35% with regard to our reference system, reaching a final EER of 13% over the NIST-AHUMADA database.

    "This paper investigates the problem of speaker identification in noisy conditions, assuming that there is no prior knowledge about the noise. To confine the effect of the noise on recognition, we use a multi-stream approach to characterize the speech signal, assuming that while all of the feature streams may be affected by the noise, there may be some streams that are less severely affected and thus still provide useful information about the speaker. Recognition decisions are based on the feature streams that are uncontaminated or least contaminated, thereby reducing the effect of the noise on recognition. We introduce a novel statistical method, the posterior union model, for selecting reliable feature streams. An advantage of the union model is that knowledge of the structure of the noise is not needed, thereby providing robustness to time-varying unpredictable noise corruption. We have tested the new method on the TIMIT database with additive corruption from real-world nonstationary noise; the results obtained are encouraging.\n",

    "Pitch mismatch between enrollment and testing is a common problem in speaker recognition systems. It is well known that the fine spectral structure related to fundamental frequency manifests itself in Mel cepstral features used for speaker recognition. Therefore pitch variations result in variation of the acoustic features, and potentially an increase in error rate. A previous study introduced a signal processing procedure termed depitch that attempts to remove pitch information from the speech signal by forcing every speech frame to be pitch synchronous and include a single pitch cycle. This paper presents a modification of the depitch algorithm, termed syncpitch, that performs pseudo pitch synchronous processing while still preserving the pitch information. The new algorithm has a relatively moderate effect on the speech signal. System combination of syncpitch with a baseline system is shown to improve speaker verification accuracy in experiments conducted on the 2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation data.\n",

    "On-line Speaker indexing is useful for multimedia applications such as meeting or teleconference archiving and browsing. It sequentially detects the points where a speaker identity changes in a multi-speaker audio stream, and classifies each speaker segment. The main problem of on-line processing is that we can use only current and previous information in the data stream for any decisioning. To address this difficulty, we apply a predetermined reference speaker-independent model set. This set can be useful for more accurate speaker modeling and clustering without actual training of target data speaker models. Once a speaker-independent model is selected from the reference set, it is adapted into a speaker-dependent model progressively. Experiments were performed with HUB-4 Broadcast News Evaluation English Test Material(1999) and Speaker Recognition Benchmark NIST Speech(1999). Results showed that our new technique gave 96.5% indexing accuracy on a telephone conversation data source and 84.3% accuracy on a broadcast news source.\n",

    "This article describes a new approach for cues discrimination between speakers addressed to a speaker identification task. To this end, we make use of elements of decision theory. We propose to decompose the conventional feature space (MFCCs) into two subspaces which carry information about discriminative and confusable sections of the speech signal. The method is based on the idea that, instead of adapting the speakers models to a new test environment, we require the test utterance to fit the speakers models environment. Discriminative sections of training speech are used to estimate the probability density function (pdf) of a discriminative world model (DM), and confusable sections to estimate the probability density function of a confusion world model (CM). The two models are then used as a maximum likelihood detector (filter) at the input of the recogniser. The method was experimented on highly mismatched telephone speech and achieves a considerable improvement (averaging 16% gain in performance) over the baseline GMM system.\n",

    "The area of automatic speaker recognition has been dominated by systems using only short-term, low-level acoustic information, such as cepstral features. While these systems have produced low error rates, they ignore higher levels of information beyond low-level acoustics that convey speaker information. Recently published works have demonstrated that such high-level information can be used successfully in automatic speaker recognition systems by improving accuracy and potentially increasing robustness. Wide ranging high-level-feature-based approaches using pronunciation models, prosodic dynamics, pitch gestures, phone streams, and conversational interactions were explored and developed under the SuperSID project at the 2002 JHU CLSP Summer Workshop (WS2002): http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ws2002/groups/supersid/. In this paper, we show how these novel features and classifiers provide complementary information and can be fused together to drive down the equal error rate on the 2001 NIST Extended Data Task to 0.2% - a 71% relative reduction in error over the previous state of the art.\n",

The paper describes the need for score normalisation in this case, and provides a detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of the methods that can be used for this purpose. The experimental investigations are based on the use of speech material drawn from 9 hours of recordings of different Broadcast News. The results clearly demonstrate the significance of improvement offered by score normalisation. It is shown that, amongst various normalisation methods considered, the unconstrained cohort normalisation method achieves the best performance in terms of reducing the errors associated with the open-set nature of the process. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that both the cohort and world model methods can offer very similar effectiveness, and also outperform the T-norm method in this particular case of speaker recognition.\n",

The resulting allophonic classes were analyzed and compared with the phonetic literature. Finally, accent \"aware\" models were built, in which the parametric complexity for each phoneme corresponds to the degree of variability across accent areas and to the amount of training data available for it. The models were compared to models with the same, but evenly spread, overall complexity showing in some cases a slight improvement in recognition accuracy.\n",

All previous studies show that PPRLM is the technique with the best performance despite of its drawbacks: more processing time and labeled data is needed. No work has been published regarding the optimum weights which should be given to the language models to optimize the performance of the language recognizer. This paper addresses this topic, providing three different approaches for weight selection in the language model score. We will also see that a trigram language model improves performance.

Keyword spotting identifies the keyword from speech queries and narrows down the search space of image collections. A scoring function is proposed to compute the similarity between speech query and annotated captions in terms of International Phonetic Alphabets. The experimental results show that the average rank and the mean reciprocal rank are 2.04 and 0.8322, respectively, which is very close to the best performance, i.e., 1, for both average rank and mean reciprocal rank.\n",

The Romus system is presented. It implements speech understanding in a two-stage process. The first stage achieves a finite-state shallow parsing that consists in segmenting the recognized sentence into basic units (spoken-adapted chunks). The second one, a Link Grammar parser, looks for inter-chunks dependencies in order to build a rich representation of the semantic structure of the utterance. These dependencies are mainly investigated at a pragmatic level through the consideration of a task concept hierarchy. Discussion about the approach adopted, its benefits and limitations, is based on the results of the system's assessment carried out under different linguistic phenomena during an evaluation campaign held by the French CNRS.\n",

    "This paper is about a system that extracts principal content words from speech-recognized transcripts of voicemail messages and classifies them into proper names, telephone numbers, dates/times and `other'. The short text summaries generated are suitable for mobile messaging applications. The system uses a set of classifiers to identify the summary words, with each word being identified by a vector of lexical and prosodic features. The features are selected using Parcel, an ROC-based algorithm. We visually compare the role of a large number of individual features and discuss effective ways to combine them. We finally evaluate their performance on manual and automatic transcriptions derived from two different speech recognition systems.\n",

    "State-of-the-art spoken language understanding (SLU) systems are trained using human-labeled utterances, preparation of which is labor intensive and time consuming. Labeling is an error-prone process due to various reasons, such as labeler errors or imperfect description of classes. Thus, usually a second (or maybe more) pass(es) of labeling is required in order to check and fix the labeling errors and inconsistencies of the first (or earlier) pass(es). In this paper, we check the effect of labeling errors for statistical call classification and evaluate methods of finding and correcting these errors by checking minimum amount of data. We describe two alternative methods to speed up the labeling effort, one is based on the confidences obtained from a prior model and the other completely unsupervised. We call the labeling process employing one of these methods as active labelling. Active labeling aims to minimize the number of utterances to be checked again by automatically selecting the ones that are likely to be erroneous or inconsistent with the previously labeled examples. Although very same methods can be used as a postprocessing step to correct labeling errors, we only consider them as part of the labeling process. We have evaluated these active labelling methods using a call classification system used for AT&T natural dialog customer care system. Our results indicate that it is possible to find about 90% of the labeling errors or inconsistencies by checking just half the data.\n",

    "State of the art spoken language understanding systems are trained using labeled utterances, which is labor intensive and time consuming to prepare. In this paper, we propose methods for exploiting the unlabeled data in a statistical call classification system within a natural language dialog system. The basic assumption is that some amount of labeled data and relatively larger chunks of unlabeled data is available. The first method augments the training data by using the machine-labeled call-types for the unlabeled utterances. The second method, instead, augments the classification model trained using the human-labeled utterances with the machine-labeled ones in a weighted manner. We have evaluated these methods using a call classification system used for AT&T natural dialog customer care system. For call classification, we have used a boosting algorithm. Our results indicate that it is possible to obtain the same classification performance by using 30% less labeled data when the unlabeled data is utilized. This corresponds to a 1-1.5% absolute classification error rate reduction, using the same amount of labeled data.\n",

    "This paper describes various noise robustness issues in a speech-to-speech translation system. We present quantitative measures for noise robustness in the context of speech recognition accuracy and speech-to-speech translation performance. To enhance noise immunity, we explore two approaches to improve the overall speech-to-speech translation performance. First, a multi-style training technique is used to tackle the issue of environmental degradation at the acoustic model level. Second, a pre-processing technique, CDCN, is exploited to compensate for the acoustic distortion at the signal level. Further improvement can be obtained by combining both schemes. In addition to recognition accuracy for speech recognition, this paper studies and examines how closely speech recognition accuracy is related the overall speech-to-speech recognition. When we apply the proposed schemes to an English-to-Chinese translation task, the word error rate for our speech recognition subsystem is substantially reduced by 28% relative, to 13.2% from 18.9% for test data of 15dB SNR. The corresponding BLEU score improves to 0.478 from 0.43 for the overall speech-to-speech translation. Similar improvements are also observed for a lower SNR condition.\n",

The framework adopts an example-based machine translation (EBMT) approach. This work reports on three extensions to the framework. First, we investigate the comparative merits of three distance metrics (Kullback-Leibler, Manhattan-Norm and Gini Index) for agglomerative clustering in grammar induction. Second, we seek an automatic evaluation method that can also consider multiple translation outputs generated for a single input sentence based on the BLEU metric. Third, our previous investigation shows that Chinese-to-English translation has lower performance due to incorrect use of English inflectional forms - a consequence of random selection among translation alternatives. We present an improved selection strategy that leverages information from the example parse trees in our EBMT paradigm.\n",

    "Recent interest in the automatic processing of meetings is motivated by a desire to summarize, browse, and retrieve important information from lengthy archives of spoken data. One of the most useful capabilities such a technology could provide is a way for users to locate \"hot spots\" or regions in which participants are highly involved in the discussion (e.g. heated arguments, points of excitement, etc.). We ask two questions about hot spots in meetings in the ICSI Meeting Recorder corpus. First, we ask whether involvement can be judged reliably by human listeners. Results show that despite the subjective nature of the task, raters show significant agreement in distinguishing involved from non-involved utterances. Second, we ask whether there is a relationship between human judgments of involvement and automatically extracted prosodic features of the associated regions. Results show that there are significant differences in both F0 and energy between involved and non-involved utterances. These findings suggest that humans do agree to some extent on the judgment of hot spots, and that acoustic-only cues could be used for automatic detection of hot spots in natural meetings.\n",

The advantages of the new model include its built-in robust feature and its scalability to an n-gram classifier when the understanding does not involve slot filling.

It is important for browsing and retrieving spoken documents, which may be automatically transcribed, but it will be much more helpful if given the titles indicating the content subjects of the documents. For title generation for Chinese language, additional problems such as word segmentation and key phrase extraction also have to be solved. In this paper, we developed a new approach of title generation for Chinese spoken documents. It includes key phrase extraction, topic classification, and a new title generation model based on an adaptive K nearest-neighbor concept. The tests were performed with a training corpus including 151,537 news stories in text form with human-generated titles and a testing corpus of 210 broadcast news stories. The evaluation included both objective F1 measures and 5-level subjective human evaluation. Very positive results were obtained.\n",

    "This paper proposes an integrated framework to summarize spontaneous speech into written-style compact sentences. Most current speech recognition systems attempt to transcribe whole spoken words correctly. However, recognition results of spontaneous speech are usually difficult to understand, even if the recognition is perfect, because spontaneous speech includes redundant information, and its style is different to that of written sentences. In particular, the style of spoken Japanese is very different to that of the written language. Therefore, techniques to summarize recognition results into readable and compact sentences are indispensable for generating captions or minutes from speech. Our speech summarization includes speech recognition, paraphrasing, and sentence compaction, which are integrated in a single Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST). This approach enables the decoder to employ all the knowledge sources in a one-pass search strategy and reduces the search errors, since all the constraints of the models are used from the beginning of the search. We conducted experiments on a 20kword Japanese lecture speech recognition and summarization task. Our approach yielded improvements in both recognition accuracy and summarization accuracy compared with other approaches that perform speech recognition and summarization separately.\n",

The huge quantities of news documents retrieved from the Web are used to construct domain-specific lexicons and language models for SQR. The named-entity extraction is used to construct a domain-specific named-entity database for SUA. It is found that by combining domain classifiers and named-entity extraction, we can not only understand cross-domain queries, but also find answers in a specific domain.\n",

    "We have proposed an automatic speech summarization approach that extracts words from transcription results obtained by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. To numerically evaluate this approach, the automatic summarization results are compared with manual summarization generated by humans through word extraction. We have proposed three metrics, weighted word precision, word strings precision and summarization accuracy (series SumACCY), based on a word network created by merging manual summarization results. In this paper, we propose a new metric for automatic summarization results, weighted summarization accuracy (series WSumACCY). This accuracy is weighted by the posterior probability of the manual summaries in the network to give the reliability of each answer extracted from the network. We clarify the goal of each metric and use these metrics to provide automatic evaluation results of the summarized speech. To compare the performance of each evaluation metric, correlations between the evaluation results using these metrics and subjective evaluation by hand are measured. It is confirmed that series WSumACCY is an effective and robust measure for automatic summarization.\n",

Focusing on audio speaker identification and verification, we propose to explore the use of novel kernel functions that take full advantage of good probabilistic and descriptive models of audio data. We explore the use of generative speaker identification models such as Gaussian Mixture Models and derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discriminative methods. Our results show that these new kernels perform as well as baseline GMM classifiers and outperform generic kernel based SVM's in both speaker identification and verification on two different audio databases.\n",

In our previous study [1], we proposed to compute the optimal weights for fusing the scores of these utterances based on their score distribution and our prior knowledge about the score statistics estimated from the mean scores of the corresponding client speaker and some pseudo-impostors during enrollment. As the fusion weights depend on the prior scores, in this paper, we propose to adapt the prior scores during verification based on the likelihood of the claimant being an impostor. To this end, a pseudo-imposter GMM score model is created for each speaker. During verification, the claimant's scores are fed to the score model to obtain a likelihood for adapting the prior score. Experimental results based on the GSM-transcoded speech of 150 speakers from the HTIMIT corpus demonstrate that the proposed prior score adaptation approach provides a relative error reduction of 15% when compared with our previous approach where the prior scores are non-adaptive.\n",

    "In speaker verification over public telephone networks, utterances can be obtained from different types of handsets. Different handsets may introduce different degrees of distortion to the speech signals. This paper attempts to combine a handset selector with (1) handset-specific transformations and (2) handset-dependent speaker models to reduce the effect caused by the acoustic distortion. Specifically, a number of Gaussian mixture models are independently trained to identify the most likely handset given a test utterance; then during recognition, the speaker model and background model are either transformed by MLLR-based handset-specific transformation or respectively replaced by a handset-dependent speaker model and a handset-dependent background model whose parameters were adapted by reinforced learning to fit the new environment. Experimental results based on 150 speakers of the HTIMIT corpus show that environment adaptation based on both MLLR and reinforced learning outperforms the classical CMS, Hnorm and Tnorm approaches, with MLLR adaptation achieves the best performance.\n",

The new method is shown to outperform several other methods in a text-dependent verification task. Several normalization methods are also compared. With three cohort models and the best score-normalization method, the CIC yielded an average Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.8%, while the second best method (Maximally-Spread Close, MSC) yielded average EER of 1.1%.\n",

This high degree of intra-speaker variability presents a major challenge for speaker verification systems. Based on a large-scale study in which different kinds of affective states were induced in over 100 speakers from three language groups, we use a statistical approach to identify speech and voice parameters that are likely to strongly vary as a function of the respective situation and affective state as well as those that tend to remain relatively stable. In addition, we evaluate the latter with respect to their potential to differentiate individual speakers.\n",

    "This paper proposes a technique to estimate speakers' perceptual age automatically only with acoustic information of their utterances. Firstly, we experimentally collected data of how old individual speakers in databases sound to listeners. Speech samples of approximately 500 male speakers with a very wide range of the real age were presented to listeners, who were asked to estimate the age only by hearing. Using the results, the perceptual age of the individual speakers was defined in two ways as label (averaged age over the listeners) and distribution. Then, each of the speakers was acoustically modeled by GMMs. Finally, the perceptual age of an input speaker was estimated as weighted sum of the perceptual age of all the other speakers in the databases, where the weight for speaker i was calculated as a function of likelihood score of the input speaker as speaker i. Experiments showed that correlation was about 0.9 between the perceptual age estimated by the listening test and that estimated by the proposed method. This paper also introduces some techniques to realize robust estimation of the perceptual age.\n",

    "Many of the problems arising in speech processing are characterized by extremely large training and testing sets, constraining the kinds of models and algorithms that lead to tractable implementations. In particular, we would like the amount of processing associated with each test frame to be sublinear (i.e., logarithmic) in the number of training points. In this paper, we consider smoothed kernel regression models at each test frame, using only those training frames that are close to the desired test frame. The problem is made tractable via the use of approximate nearest neighbors techniques. The resulting system is conceptually simple, easy to implement, and fast, with performance comparable to more sophisticated methods. Preliminary results on a NIST speaker recognition task are presented, demonstrating the feasibility of the method.\n",

A fully coupled target and background Gaussian mixture speaker model structure is used for hypothesis testing in this speaker model based recognition system. Two formulations of the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) adaptation algorithm for Gaussian mixture models are considered. We contrast the standard single iteration adaptation algorithm to adaptation using multiple iterations. Three post-processing techniques for cepstral features are considered; feature warping, cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) and RelAtive SpecTrA (RASTA) processing. It is shown that the advantage gained through iterative MAP adaptation is dependent on the parameterisation technique used. Reasons for this dependency are discussed.\n",

Our investigations concentrate on the determination of a proper model complexity and show the multilingual models' capability to handle cases where a non-native speaker is borrowing phones from his or her native language.

It expands an existing RNN-based prosodic information generator for Mandarin TTS to an RNN-MLP scheme for Mandarin-English mixed-lingual TTS. It first treats each English word as a Chinese word and uses the RNN, trained for Mandarin TTS, to generate a set of initial prosodic information for each syllable of the English word. It then refines the initial prosodic information by using additional MLPs. The resulting prosodic information is expected to be appropriate for English-word synthesis as well as to match well with that of the background Mandarin speech. Experimental results showed that the proposed RNN-MLP scheme performed very well. For English word spelling/reading, RMSEs of 41.8/78.2 ms, 30.8/26 ms, 0.65/0.45 ms/frame, and 3.06/4.9 dB were achieved in the open tests for the synthesized syllable duration, inter-syllable pause duration, pitch contour, and energy level, respectively.

This method uses English and Japanese phoneme acoustic models and a pronunciation lexicon in which each word has both English and Japanese phoneme transcriptions. The same utterances are used for adaptation of both acoustic models. A recognition system uses these two adapted acoustic models and the lexicon, and the highest-likelihood word sequence obtained in combining with English- and Japanese-pronounced words is the recognition result. Continuous speech recognition experiments show that the proposed adaptation method greatly improves both Japanese-English and native- English recognition performance, and the system using bilingual adapted models achieves the highest accuracy for Japanese speakers among those using monolingual models, while maintaining the same performance level for native speakers as that of an English recognition system using an English adapted model.\n",

In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to develop multilingual acoustic models that achieve comparable performance relative to monolingual acoustic models but with only a fraction of the storage space of the combined monolingual acoustic model set.\n",

    "The resources necessary to produce Automatic Speech Recognition systems for a new language are considerable, and for many languages these resources are not available. This emphasizes the need for the development of generic techniques which overcome this data shortage. Indonesian is one language which suffers from this problem and whose population and importance suggest it could benefit from speech enabled technology. Accordingly, we investigate using English acoustic models to recognize Indonesian speech. The mapping process, where the symbolic representation of the Source language acoustic models is equated to the Target language phonetic units, has typically been achieved using one to one mapping techniques. This mapping method does not allow for the incorporation of predictable allophonic variation in the lexicon. Accordingly, in this paper we present the use of cross-lingual pronunciation modelling to extract context dependant mapping rules, which are subsequently used to produce a more accurate cross lingual lexicon.\n",

    "The success of statistical language modeling techniques is crucially dependent on the availability of a large amount training text. For a language in which such large text collections are not available, methods have recently been proposed to take advantage of a resource-rich language, together with cross-lingual information retrieval and machine translation, to sharpen language models for the resource-deficient language. In this paper, we describe investigations into such language models for an automatic speech recognition system for Mandarin Broadcast News. By exploiting a large side-corpus of contemporaneous English news articles to adapt a static Chinese language model to the news story being transcribed, we demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy. The improvement from using English text is greater when less Chinese text is available to estimate the static language model. We also compare our cross-lingual adaptation to monolingual topic-dependent language model adaptation, and achieve further gains by combining the two adaptation techniques.\n",

    "In this paper, a multilingual acoustic model set derived from English, Hindi, and Spanish is utilised to recognise speech in Indonesian. In order to achieve this task we incorporate a two tiered approach to perform the cross-lingual porting of the multilingual models to a new language. In the first stage, we use an entropy based decision tree to merge similar phones from different languages into clusters to form a new multilingual model set. In the second stage, we propose the use of a cross-lingual pronunciation modelling technique to perform the mapping from the multilingual models to the Indonesian phone set. A set of mapping rules are derived from this process and are employed to convert the original Indonesian lexicon into a pronunciation lexicon in terms of the multilingual model set. Preliminary experimental results show that, compared to the common knowledge based approach, both of these techniques reduce the word error rate in a spontaneous speech recognition task.\n",

    "Development of robust spoken language technology ideally relies on the availability of large amounts of data preferably in the target domain and language. However, more often than not, speech developers need to cope with very little or no data, typically obtained from a different target domain. This paper focuses on developing techniques towards addressing this challenge. Specifically we consider the case of developing a Persian language speech recognizer with sparse amounts of data. For language modeling, there are several potential sources of text data, e.g., available on the Internet, to help bootstrap initial models; however, acoustic data can be obtained only by tedious data collection efforts. The drawback of limited Persian acoustic data can be partially overcome by making use of acoustic data from languages that have vast resources such as English (and other languages, if available). The phoneme sets especially for diverse languages such as English and Persian differ considerably. However by incorporating knowledge-based as well as data-driven phoneme mappings, reliable Persian acoustic models can be trained using well-trained English models and small amounts of Persian re-training data. In our experiments Persian models re-trained from seed models created by data-driven phoneme mappings of English models resulted in a phoneme error rate of 19.80% as compared to a phoneme error rate of 20.35% when the Persian models were re-trained from seed models created by sparse Persian data.\n",

    "Large vocabulary speech recognition systems traditionally represent words in terms of subword units, usually phonemes. This paper investigates the potential of graphemes acting as subunits. In order to develop context dependent grapheme based speech recognizers several decision tree based clustering procedures are performed and compared to each other. Grapheme based speech recognizers in three languages - English, German, and Spanish - are trained and compared to their phoneme based counterparts. The results show that for languages with a close grapheme-to-phoneme relation, grapheme based modeling is as good as the phoneme based one. Furthermore, multilingual grapheme based recognizers are designed to investigate whether grapheme based information can be successfully shared among languages. Finally, some bootstrapping experiments for Swedish were performed to test the potential for rapid language deployment.\n",

The system first identifies word accent types in a learner's utterance using F_0 change between two adjacent morae as the feature parameter. As for the representative F_0 value for a mora, we defined one with a good match to the perceived pitch. The system notices the user if his/her pronunciation is good or not, and, then, generates audio and visual corrective feedbacks. Using TDPSOLA technique, the learner's utterance is modified in its prosodic features by referring to teacher's features, and offered to the learner as the audio corrective feedback. The visual feedback is also offered to enhance the modifications that occurred. Accent type pronunciation training experiments were conducted for 8 non-Japanese speakers, and the results showed that the training process could be facilitated by the feedbacks especially when they were asked to pronounce sentences.\n",

    "Due to various difficulties in pronunciation, utterances by non-native speakers may be lacking in fluency. The Japanese pronunciation is said to have mora-synchronism, and, therefore, we assume that the disfluency may cause larger variations in vowel durations. Analyses of vowel (and CV) durations were conducted for Japanese sentence utterances by 2 non-Japanese speakers and one Japanese speaker (all female speakers). Larger variations were clearly observed in non-Japanese utterances. Then, 10 Japanese speakers were asked to rate the non-Japanese utterances. Strong negative correlations were observed between durational variations and pronunciation ratings. Based on the result, a method was developed for automatic evaluation of non- Japanese utterances. The ratings by the method were shown to be close to those by native speakers. Also, in order to offer a corrective feedback in learner's voice, non-Japanese utterances were modified in their vowel durations by referring to native Japanese utterances. The modification was done using TD-PSOLA scheme. The result of listening test indicated some improvements in nativeness.\n",

    "This paper investigates the perceptual quality of English words recorded by different types of microphones to assess their availability in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) systems. English words minimally contrasting in /r/ and /l/, /b/ and /v/, or /s/ and /th/ were recorded from native female and male speakers of American English using six different microphones. The phonemic contrasts in these recordings were then evaluated by 14 native listeners of American English. The results showed that the identification of the /r/-/l/ contrast was unaltered by the difference in microphones, whereas that of the /s/-/th/ contrast significantly dropped with several headset microphones, and that of the /b/-/v/ contrast dropped with a tie-pin microphone. These findings suggest that some microphones are not appropriate for speech perception training. Finally, a post hoc equalization procedure was applied to compensate for the acoustic characteristics of the microphones tested, and this procedure was confirmed to be effective in recovering phonemic contrasts under several conditions.\n",

The goal is to improve the speech recognizer's ability to detect miscues but limit the number of \"false alarms\" (correctly read words misclassified as incorrect). The \"rote\" method listens for specific miscues from a training corpus. The \"extrapolative\" method generalizes to predict other miscues on other words. We construct and evaluate a scheme that combines our rote and extrapolative models. This combined approach reduced false alarms by 0.52% absolute (12% relative) while simultaneously improving miscue detection by 1.04% absolute (4.2% relative) over our existing miscue prediction scheme.\n",

In the field of speech synthesis, many investigations have been made to control prosody so that it conforms to the syntactic structure of the sentence. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem: recovery of syntactic structure with the help of prosodic information. In our past investigations, it was observed that duration of inter-phrase pause is most effective among various prosodic features in dependency structure analysis of Japanese sentences. In those studies, only one kind of pause, i.e. the pause that immediately follows a phrase in question was used. In this paper, another kind of pause is employed as a prosodic feature: the pause that immediately follows the succeeding phrase of a phrase in question. It is shown that simultaneous use of the first and second pauses improves the parsing accuracy compared to the case where only the first pause is used.\n",

    "Modern Japanese texts often include Western sourced words written in Roman alphabet. For example, a shopping directory in a web portal, which lists more than 8,000 shops, includes a total of 6,400 alphabetic words. As most of them are very new and idiosyncratic proper nouns, it is impractical to assume all those alphabetic words can be registered in the word dictionary of a text-to-speech synthesis system; their pronunciations must be derived automatically. Our solution consists of two steps. Step 1 classifies each unknown alphabetic word into a say-as class (English, Japanese, French, Italian or English spell-out), which indicates how it is to be read, and Step 2 derives the pronunciation using the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules for the classified say-as class. This paper proposes a method of say-as classification (i.e. Step 1) that uses the Support Vector Machine. After some trial and error, we achieved 89.2% accuracy for web shop data, which we think sufficient for practical use.\n",

    "Sound-imitation words, a sound-related subset of onomatopoeia, are important for computer-human interaction and automatic tagging of sound archives. The main problem of automatic recognition of sound-imitation word is that the literal representation of such words is dependent on listeners and influenced by a particular cultural history. Based on our preliminary experiments of such dependency and the sonority theory, we discovered that the process of transforming environmental sounds into syllable-structure expressions is mostly listener-independent while that of transforming syllable-structure expressions into sound-imitation words is mostly listener-dependent and influenced by culture. This paper focuses on the former lister-independent process and presents the three-stage architecture of automatic transformation of environmental sounds to sound-imitation words; segmenting sound signals to syllables, identifying syllable structure as mora, and recognizing mora as phonemes.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a statistical method of evaluating the pronunciation proficiency of English words spoken by Japanese. We analyze statistically the utterances to find a combination that has a high correlation between an English teacher's score and some acoustic features. We found that the likelihood ratio of English phoneme acoustic models to phoneme acoustic models adapted by Japanese was the best measure of pronunciation proficiency. The combination of the likelihood for American native models, likelihood for English models adapted by Japanese, the best likelihood for arbitrary sequences of acoustic models, phoneme recognition rate and the rate of speech are highly related to the English teacher's score. We obtained the correlation coefficient of 0.81 with open data for vocabulary and 0.69 with open data for speaker at the five words set level, respectively. The coefficient was higher than the correlation between humans' scores, 0.65.\n",
