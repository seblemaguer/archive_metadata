    "This paper reports on tests of three different stress-timing effects in a corpus of spontaneous utterances, elicited in a task which prompted naive speakers to produce many tokens of relevant target phrases. Several independent transcriptions of stress and intonation patterns were obtained. The intonation markings were used to control for phrase boundaries in interpreting duration measurements for polysyllabic shortening and stress clash effects. The first, but not the second is robustly demonstrated. The intonation patterns and stress transcriptions were also used to understand stress shift and to show where it will occur. The results show the intricate link between intonation and rhythm, making it crucial to obtain judgments of accent and intonational phrasing in experiments on speech rhythms in languages like English.\n",

    "To test whether a measure of lengthening can be found which applies to segments uniformly within the syllable, instead of differentially with respect to segment type or position in the syllable, the durations of each segment in the SCRIBE 200-sentence phonetically balanced database were converted to standard normal form by subtracting the means and expressing the residuals in terms of their standard deviations to yield a mean of zero and a variance of 1 for each phoneme distribution. These normalised values were taken to represent the amount of lengthening or compression undergone by each segment relative to its elasticity. This paper explores the extent to which lengthening or compression measured in this way applies within the syllable, and shows that stress-induced lengthening may be differentiated from intonation-phrase-final lengthening, which is in turn different from the phonetically-motivated lengthening that is undergone by vowels preceeding voiced plosives.\n",

The work includes (1) the development of an integer break index representation of prosodic phrase boundary information, (2) the automatic detection of prosodic phrase breaks using a hidden Markov model on relative duration of phonetic segments, and (3) the integration of the prosodic phrase break information in SRI's Spoken Language System to rule out alternative parses in otherwise syntactically ambiguous sentences. Automatically detected phrase break indices had a correlation of greater than 0.8 with hand-labeled data for speaker-dependent and independent models; and in a subset of sentences with preposition ambiguities, the number of parses was reduced by 25% with a simple grammar modification.\n",

    "In this paper, duration control factors are statistically analyzed using Japanese speech data uttered by four speakers. According to previous studies, the important factors are phoneme category, neighboring phonemes, position in breath group and mora count of breath group. In addition to the above factors, we introduce several new control factors. They are position in phrase, mora count of phrase, content / function word category, pre- and post-adjacent phonemes, and temporal compensation caused by geminated consonants. Using these statistically significant factors, a vowel duration model is proposed for Japanese speech synthesis. The duration prediction experiments using this model showed that the root mean square errors between predicted duration and observed duration were 15.30ms (19.6% of the average length) for vowels in the training set, and 15.84ms (19.9% of the average length) for vowels in the testing set.\n",

    "This study is part of a larger project in which we investigate the communicatively important aspects in spontaneous speech as compared to read texts. To start with we first concentrated on spectro-temporal and intonational aspects of focus words (i.e. words bearing the highest load of semantic information) in spontaneous speech and in the same texts, re-read after ortho- graphic transcription, against the background of some global acoustic parameters of both speech styles. Use is made of speech material produced by one professional male speaker (model for the diphone-based component of the Dutch national speech synthesis program). Although measurements on local acoustic parameters are still in progress, first results on some global background parameters reveal hardly any overall durational difference between spontaneous speech and the same text read aloud, but large differences in mean fundamental frequency and fundamental frequency range. Results of global and local acoustic parameters together will be used to establish the role of focus words, within read as well as in spontaneous speech.\n",

    "One naturally spoken token of the words beru and beeru was edited by LPC synthesis to produce stimuli varying in the timing of F0 fall. These stimuli were presented in two durational contexts to listeners representing the three varieties of Japanese who were asked to judge which of the words the stimuli sounded like. The results showed that there was a significant effect of F0 pattern on the judgement made by the Standard and Osaka group whereas no such effect was observed for the accentless group. The durational context played no role for the former group but increased accuracy in judgement for the latter group. The finding that F0 pattern influenced the perception of vowel mora in the Standard/Osaka group gives support to the traditional description that it is the mora, not the syllable, that is the unit of tone assignment in these varieties of Japanese, However, it does not support the definition of the Japanese mora as fundamentally a durational phenomena and nothing else.\n",

    "A novel method for nonlinear prediction of speech is introduced which does not require a parametric model of the predictor. The observable past is vector quantized and a nonlinear prediction is obtained by a table lookup, addressed by the index of the quantized input vector. The table is designed with speech training data. Experimental results for a moving-average process confirm that nearly optimal nonlinear prediction is achievable. Results for speech show that the performance depends on both the size of the vector quantizer codebook and the size of the training set. The method is applied to DPCM and some useful performance gain is demonstrated.\n",

    "Conventional linear prediction of speech suffers from oversimplification in both vocal tract modeling and voice source modeling. We have presented a six-parameter model for the glottal source and a method for simultaneous estimation of voice source and vocal tract parameters based on an ARMA model combined with the glottal model (henceforth the GARMA method ). This paper describes further effort to refine our previous proposal. Taking into account the non-Gaussian nature of the innovation for voiced speech sounds, the robust signal processing techniques are introduced as an effective means of separating the voice source from the vocal tract transfer function. By minimizing the sum of appropriately weighted errors rather than the sum of squared errors, the proposed method is more robust against glottal excitation as well as random noise interferences. Therefore higher synthesized speech quality can be obtained by the robust GARMA method.\n",

The model spectrum represented by the generalized cepstrum varies from the all-pole spectrum to that represented by the cepstrum according to the value of the parameter 7 in the range of [-1,0]. We apply the criterion used in the unbiased estimation of log spectrum to the spectral model. As a result, the proposed method includes linear prediction and the unbiased estimation of log spectrum as the special cases. To solve the non-linear minimization problem involved in the method, we give an iterative algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed. The stability of the model solution is guaranteed. We also show some results of natural speech analysis to discuss the optimal value of 7 in the sense of minimizing the prediction error.\n",

    "Temporal decomposition (TD), an analysis procedure introduced by Atal in 1983, yields a linear approximation of speech parameters in terms of a series of time-overlapping interpolation functions and an associated series of data vectors. Essentially, TD is based on a linear model of the effects of coarticulation, the coarticulation effects being modelled by the overlap of neighboring interpolation functions. This method does not make use of any specific phonetic knowledge and can be applied to any time-sequence of data vectors. In this paper we will discuss some of the constraints which must be imposed on such a linear approximation and describe a new and improved method for constructing the interpolation functions.\n",

    "The speech analysis method based on a glottal source model is important for efficiently constructing a rule-based speech synthesis system, since it is easy to control parameters, it can obtain smooth spectral trajectories and it can reduce memory capacity to store the parameters. This paper proposes a new speech analysis method based on the glottal source model. The proposed method uses glottal source and vocal tract inverse filterings in the frequency domain, and the model parameters are calculated so as to minimize inverse filtered error. The method can significantly reduce the computation amount and can assure vocal tract filter stability. Speech analysis synthesis experiments were carried out. The experimental results show that the speech spectrum is estimated more accurately and the estimated pole trajectory is smoother in the proposed method than in the conventional one. Further, synthetic speech is natural and intelligible. The results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for a rule-based speech synthesis system.\n",

    "In an effort to improve existing multipulse LP speech synthesis methods, we propose in this paper a new multipulse synthesis method which is devised to modify in two aspects the exisiting multipulse algorithms. First, in order to lessen the influence of the pitch periodicity of voiced speech upon conventional estimation of vocal tract, sample selective LP analysis is applied to estimate the vocal tract transfer function and thus is used as the synthesis filter of MPLPC method. Conventional residual signal is exploited so as to sort out from the analysis set those speech samples which have seemingly been influenced by the pitch bias effect. Second, instead of searching, for the pulses on every point in the frame, a new method, called candidate locations restricted searching (CLRS), is devised so that computational loads for the multipulse searching could be lessened.\n",

It is rather revealing to find out that the scaling factors are a conditional probability of observing the current symbol given all the past observed symbols. And the single symbol emission probability is independent of time if the initial state distribution is the limit distribution of the corresponding Markov chain. To make the real-time implementation of reestimation possible, we derive the forward evaluation of the backward probabilities. Binomial distribution is introduced to model the state transitions of HMM. This increases not only the flexibility of the model but also the modelling power of HMM. Simulation results are presented.\n",

A comprehensive translaryngeal pressure-flow equation is offered. A model of the larynx 7.5 times life size was used with 63 combinations of glottal angles and diameters. The translaryngeal pressure-flow data were nondimensionalized into a pressure coefficient P* and Reynolds number Re such that P* = (A1/Re) + A2. A1 and A2 were empirically determined from the data, and were structured on Poiseuille, diffuser, and optimum pressure recovery considerations. For pressure drops ranging between 3 and 50 cm H2O, the average mean difference between the equation predictions and the empirical data was 4.45% (sd 3.38%). The results can be used in phonatory models or speech synthesis schemes for which volume velocity is dependent upon subglottal pressure and glottal configuration.\n",

    "By using a newly developed high-speed digital Image recording system, the relationship between vocal cord vibration and voice source charateristics has been investigated. The system employs either a fiberscope or a solid type endoscope combined with an image sensor and a digital image memory. Video signals from the image sensor are A/D converted and stored in the image memory. Since the system does not have any mechanical unit producing noise sounds, simultaneous recording of vocal cord vibration and speech signal can. be performed easily. Fiberscope system made it possible to observe vocal cord vibration during running speech. Specifically, pattern of vocal cord vibration at the release of the consonants were analysed. Solid endoscope system has been used for observing sustained phonation of pathological voice. It has brighter image than fiberscope system and thus, has better resolution. Many cases of rough voice show asymmetric and/or asynchronous movements between the right and left vocal cords, and between the anterior and posterior to parts of the vocal cords. These movements appear to be related the periodical fluctuations in the vibratory pattern which produce corresponding fluctuations in the speech waveform.\n",

The simulated glottal flow waveforms showed the same kind of details as observed in real measurements, i.e. a main flow pulse followed by a smaller one while the dip in between is a function of abduction. We could explain the non-negligible flow after the lower parts of the vocal folds have come into contact, by assuming that it consists of two components. One flow component arises when glottal leakage is combined with vertical phasing [3,4], The other component was identified as squish flow.\n",

    "Dynamic variations of the voice source in ordinary speech have been studied by means of inverse filtering of the sound pressure wave. The inverse filtered voice pulses have been matched by the LF-model to achieve a parametric description. Special attention was given to the spectrum of the pulses. The speech material consisted of sentences and vowels uttered by three female speakers judged to differ in voice quality. The voices were judged to be normal and their quality ranged from somewhat tight and sonorous to thin. The variation of the voice source parameters with place and manner of articulation will be discussed. The length of the closing time in the voice pulse is shown to vary with vowel height; a more open vowel shows a shorter closing time. This tendency seem to be true for the three different voices studied even though the range can vary with voice type. Consonants have been studied, especially concerning the influence of spectral zeros and the transition between consonants and vowels. Variations of the different glottal parameters within sentences have also been studied in relation to voice type.\n",

    "The present paper deals with a new noninvasive method of diagnosing vocal cord polyp through hoarse voice analysis. A noteworthy feature of this method is that it enables us not only to discriminate hoarse voices caused by pathological vocal cords with a single polyp from hoarse voices due to other laryngeal diseases but also to estimate polyp features such as the mass and dimension of polyp through the use of a novel model of pathological vocal cords which has been devised to simulate the subtle movement of the vocal cords with a single polyp. A syn- thetic hoarse voice produced with a hoarse voice synthesizer is compared with a natural hoarse voice caused by the vocal cord polyp in terms of a distance measure and the polyp features are estimated by minimizing the distance measure. Some estimates of polyp dimension that have been obtained by applying this procedure to hoarse voices are found to compare favorably with actual polyp dimensions, demonstrating that the procedure is effective for the diagnosis of vocal cord polyp.\n",

    "Unsteady viscous flows in two-dimensional static models of the glottis are numerically analyzed using a finite element method, and from those results, the physical characteristics of the glottal flow are considered. Since the glottal flow is sensitively affected by the shape of the vocal cord muscles, we make representative experiments on diverging, converging and uniform shaped glottal models in the case of wide diameter, and compare the flow fields between these models. After we briefly note the computing method for simulating the glottal flow numerically, equivalent impedance of the glottal flow is identified from the results of the finite element simulation. After that, pressure distributions along the vocal cord surfaces are discussed. The pressure distributions are almost accordant with Bernoulli's theorem and with the losses due to viscosity and nonlinearity. Furthermore, time-series of supraglottal pressure are shown and they are analyzed in the frequency domain. The supraglottal pressure would appear to be related to the rate of generation of the vortices, and to affect the acoustical propagation of the vocal tract.\n",

The LF-model is used to quantify voice source parameters and ultimately as the basis for resynthesis. First of all, the nature and directionality of coarticulatory effects of voiced/voiceless segments are looked at across languages. Results show some striking cross-language differences, and some of these can be closely linked to the temporal coordination of laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures. Voice source variations due to prosodic context (degree of stress) are also dealt with briefly. Concerning paralinguistic variation, ongoing work is presented on different voice qualities as produced by a single speaker. In conclusion, some implications for voice source rules in speech synthesis are mentioned.\n",

    "The coding of telephone band vowels has been studied in this research by using a speech production model that consists of three separated parts: the glottal excitation, the vocal tract and the lip radiation effect. The processes were identified and computed using the AIF-method. In the coding procedure the obtained glottal excitation was replaced by impulse responses of low order LPC-filters. The difference between the time domain characteristics of the original and the coded excitation is extensive but their frequency domain curves are similar. The vocal tract and the lip radiation effects were coded as an eigth order LPC-filter and a differentiator, respectively. The results of this study serve as a promising basis for further studies in order to create a low bit rate speech coder that is based on a more reliable modeling of speech production in comparison to conventional LPC.\n",

    "The choice an algorithm of speech coding is very important to achieve high quality speech at low bit rates. Speech can be modeled using LPC and Sinusoidal Transform Coding (STC). In LPC, it leads to CELP type coders [l][2]. In CELP, during vector quantization of the excitation, all components are matched as a single vector. This produces background noise and hence roughness below 4.8 kbits/s. In STC [3], on the other hand, the model parameters (phase and frequency) are very sensitive to quantization errors. This affects the performance of this system under channel errors even though it produces high quality speech at low bit rates. In our previous work, we used sine wave components to represent the CELP excitation [4] and LPC residual waveform [6] which both are capable of synthesizing speech without the artifacts common to model-based speech system. In this paper, we present the sine wave excited linear prediction (SWELP) speech model which has been found to be robust in the presence of quantization noise in speech. These characteristics make the model particularly useful in the development of high quality speech coding system at low bit rates.\n",

    "This paper proposes 8kb/s LCELP (Learned Code Excited LPC Coding). In order to improve conventional CELP speech quality with relatively low computational complexity, LCELP uses a two-stage vector quantizer with learned and random code-books. The advantages of using both the learned codebook and the random codebook are that synthetic quality is improved by the learned codebook and that robustness for any speech is enhanced by the random codebook. The learned codebook is designed using a speech database, and the random codebook is designed using white Gaussian signals. In order to allocate more bits to the learned and the random codebooks, LSP parameters are efficiently quantized by using a vector-scalar quantization (VQ-SQ) technique. Computer simulation results show that 8 kb/s LCELP achieves an average of 14.5 dB segmental SNR, which is 0.9 dB higher than that for the conventional CELP [2]. Informal listening tests show that LCELP speech quality is high and close to 56 kb/s ...-law PCM.\n",

    "The block quantizers such as a matrix quantizer and a segment quantizer are used in low-bit-rate speech coding systems. It has been demonstrated that block quantizers have good benefits in bit rate when the codeword label is transmitted with duration time information. Although, if we send speech information in fixed bit rate, the quantizer must have some fixed boundaries between quantized matrices, and this limitation induces a great deal of degradation on quantization performance. To solve this problem, we propose a new spectral quantization technique called the time-domain flexible matrix quantization (TFMQ) which based on the fact that listeners are insensitive to the degradation by a small amount of time-warping transformation. Subjective and objective quality evaluations on TFMQ have been performed for 40 short Japanese sentences talked by one male speaker. The results have shown that TFMQ has superoir perceptual performance than conventional matrix quantizers. And it have been shown that the improvement is mainly brougt by the time-warping transformation in the manner of minimizing the matching distortion, and the slight difference in the time-domain structure is absorbed efficiently by this transformation.\n",

    "This paper will present the Pitch-Orthogonal LPC speech coding technique. Pitch-Orthogonal LPC codes the residual in a vector excitation speech coder (VXC ) using the projection of the target vector into each of a series of \"codevector planes,\" where each plane is defined by a pair of vectors, the code and the pitch, which have been transformed to make their optimum gain functions independent. We will show how, using the \"backward-transform\" structure, POLPC can be used to take advantage of the low complexity offered by sparse, lattice, sparse-delta, and other efficient codebook structures in a way that standard simultaneous gain optimization VXC (SGOC) can't. Finally, we will show how this same backward-transform structure can be used with multi-stage coding to create low-complexity, jointly optimized multi-stage VXC speech coders, extending the dimension of coding accuracy by extending the codevector plane into a higher-dimensional hyperplane. Simulation results will be given which show that backward-transform POLPC provides quality identical to that of SGOC, at a computational complexity which is less than that of SGOC by a factor roughly proportional to the number of codevectors.\n",

    "The prospect of multi-channel/multi-user speech communication via the emerging ISDN has raised a lot of interest in advanced coding algorithms for 7KHz wideband speech. The capability of 32Kb/s wideband speech coding will support sustained high-quality stereo (or bilingual) voice transmission for audio-video teleconferencing over a basic rate 64Kb/s ISDN channel. In addition to the high-quality requirement, network applications are likely to dictate the use of algorithms with a very short coding delay. This paper reports on the use of the well known Codebook Excited Linear Predictive (CELP) [1»3] algorithm for 32Kb/s low-delay (LD-CELP) coding of wideband speech. The main problem associated with wideband coding, namely, spectral noise weighting, is discussed. The paper proposes an enhanced noise weighting technique and demonstrates its efficiency via subjective listening tests. In these tests, involving 20 listeners and 8 test sentences, the average ratings for the proposed 32Kb/s LD-CELP was essentially equal to that of the 64Kb/s standard (G.722) CCITT wideband coder.\n",

    "A talker verification system based on characterizing talker utterances as sequences of sub-word units represented by Hidden Markov Models (HMM's) has been implemented and tested. Two types of subword units have been studied, phone-like units (PLU's) and acoustic segment units (ASU's). PLU's are based on phonetic transcriptions of spoken utterances and ASU's are extracted directly from the acoustic signal without use of any linguistic knowledge. The ASU representation has the advantage of not requiring transcriptions of training utterances. Verification performance has been evaluated on a 20-talker database of isolated digit utterances and a 20-talker database of continously spoken sentences drawn from a 1000-word vocabulary. In the isolated digit experiments the verification equal-error rate is approximately 7 to 8% for 1-digit test utterances (approximately 0.5 sec in duration) and 1% or less for 7-digit test utterances (approximately 3.5 sec in duration) with only small differences in performance between PLU- and ASU-based representations. In the continuously spoken sentences experiments using ASU's the best verification performance is 1.7% equal-error rate for 5 second test trials. This is obtained using 64 ASU models trained from 90 seconds of speech. In addition, a technique for updating models, using data from current test utterances, has been devised and implemented. Using this adaptation technique for isolated digits, the error rate falls to 6% for 1-digit utterances and less than 0.5% for 7-digit utterances. The experiments show that excellent verification performance can be obtained with sub-word units represented by HMM's. The techniques can be readily expended from small vocabularies and isolated words to large vocabularies and connected sentences.\n",

We then compare the performance of four kinds of HMM parameter adaptation methods which may be used in the second stage to transform HMM parameters for a new speaker; adaptation by the Viterbi algorithm, that by the DTW algorithm, that by the iterative alignment algorithm, and that by the fuzzy mapped codebook algorithm. The results show that adaptation based on the mapped codebook and the DTW algorithm yields the highest accuracy in an HMM-based speech recognition system.\n",

    "This paper proposes a new speaker adaptation method using speaker weights for multiple reference speaker training. The speaker weights are calculated to reflect the similarity of each reference speaker's dynamic features to an input speaker. They are used to have the similarities affect to hidden Markov models. The evaluation experiments are carried out through the /b,d,g,m,n,N/ phoneme recognition task using 8 speakers. Average recognition rates are 68.0%, 66.4%, and 65.6% respectively for three test sets which have different speech styles, that is, word utterances, phrase-by-phrase utterances and continuous utterances. These are 1.6%, 6.7%, and 8.2% respectively higher than the supplemented HMM rates.\n",

    "In this paper we describe a method of rapid speaker adaptation that uses speech from multiple reference speakers to improve performance for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. This method is an extension of our previous work in which we estimated a speaker transformation between a single reference speaker and the new (target) speaker based on a small sample of speech of each speaker. The transformation is applied to the parameters of a speaker-dependent (SD) phonetic hidden Markov model (HMM) made for the reference speaker to make an adapted model for the target. In the present work, we estimate multiple independent transformations between a set of reference speakers and a single target speaker and then combine the resulting adapted models. We have tested this approach on the DARPA 1000-word Resource Management continuous speech corpus using the standard word-pair grammar of perplexity 60. We used 30 minutes of speech from each of 11 reference speakers to train the reference HMMs. Using 2 minutes of adaptation speech from the target speakers, the average recognition performance is 4.1% word error. This error rate is nearly 40% less than that achieved by adaptation from a single reference speaker.\n",

    "In this paper we discuss spectrum differences between different languages. This research is motivated by a \"cross-language voice conversion\". The goal of cross-language voice conversion is to preserve the individuality of a speaker's speech when that speaker's utterances are translated and used to synthesize speech in another language. To investigate the spectrum difference caused by language differences, the speech uttered by a bilingual speaker is analyzed. Experimental results are as follows: (l)the size of spectrum space is smaller in the inter-language case (between English and Japanese) than in the inter-speaker case, (2)the overlap of inter-language spectrum space is larger than the overlap of inter-speaker, (3)the unique spectra in English are /r/,/se/,/s/,/f/, and the unique spectra in Japanese are /i/,/u/,/N/, (4)although there is a critical boundary between the unique spectra in English and Japanese spectrum space, Japanese spectrum space contains some spectra which are close to the unique spectra in English, (5) judging from listening tests, the dynamic characteristics also play an important role to characterize a language.\n",

    "This paper presents both supervised and unsupervised spectral mapping methods between speakers, and an application to voice conversion based on PSE analysis-synthesis system. In both mapping methods, a spectrum of one speaker is converted to that of another speaker by interpolating the estimated speaker difference vectors at given points in the spectral space. In the supervised method, these speaker difference vectors are estimated minimizing the spectral distortion along the DTW path between the mapped and target spectral sequences for training samples. In the unsupervised method, after mapping the spectral codebook of the target speaker onto the source speaker based on a minimum fuzzy objective function, the source spectra are converted by a fuzzy mapping using the mapped and target code-books. A voice conversion experiment showed that, in male-to-male conversion, both methods attained an average correct score of 84 % in speaker discrimination for the converted voices, and that, in male-to-female conversion, an average correct score of 70 % was obtained for the supervised method.\n",

One female professional singer, who can consistently control six qualities was the subject of the experiment. Multiple repetitions were made of each quality at four fundamental frequencies: 192, 294, 392, and 587 Hz, as airflow, sound pressure levels, and electroglottographic measurements were recorded. In most of the qualities, air flow rate and acoustic intensity showed high correlation. Glottal efficiency, computed from these aerodynamic and acoustic measures, divided the six singing qualities into two groups: four loud qualities and two soft quantities. In the loud group, glottal efficiency increased with higher frequencies. The soft qualities, on the other hand, showed maximum efficiency in the middle frequency range.\n",

    "This paper describes a model of the voice source and of formant trajectories which can be used in developing a high-fidelity speech synthesizer. A polynomial model was used to generate the glottal source. Formant trajectories are modelled as the sum of two kinds of functions: one represents vowel-to-vowel transitions and the other represents the effects of surrounding consonants upon the formants. The intelligibility and fidelity were tested for the speech synthesized based on the model at slow and fast speaking rates. Compared to speech obtained by an analysis-synthesis method, the model slightly improved the intelligibility of vowels at both speaking rates, and of consonants at slow rate. For consonants at fast rate, the model made the intelligibility decrease by 6%. The polynomial model of the glottal source could reproduce to some extent delicate voice quality differences in vowels uttered at various pitch and loudness. It was found that this model is useful as a high-fidelity synthesizer with variable speaking rate.\n",

In order to explain the phenomena, a two-source vocal tract model is proposed. In the model, the vocal tract is expressed as a non-uniform single tube including the under glottal portion. Giving the vowel vocal tract area function corresponding to the 5 vowels of Japanese and two other parameters: the source position and the power ratio, vocal tract pole-zero transfer functions are calculated and an articulatory/acoustic nomogram is constructed. As the results of the inspection if there is a correspondence between the PSE of real speech and one of the nomogram's frequency transfer characteristics in pole-zeroes, the authors present the following hypothesis: \"The continuous speech vowel part PSE has the kind of pole-zero structure generated by the two-source vocal tract model\".\n",

In this paper, we evaluate the sound quality of ARMA speech synthesis with multipulse excitation by signal-to-noise ratio. The ARMA parameters of the synthesis filter are estimated by an adaptive algorithm which smoothes the estimated parameters through modeled time-varying ARMA parameters. The results show that the SNR have been improved in the ARMA synthesis that compared with the AR synthesis by using the same adaptive estimation method. Furthermore, the results suggest the importance of selecting the coefficients of the synthesis filter as the most adequate parameter set in a frame of speech from the estimated parameters by adaptive estimation.\n",

    "A Japanese text-to-speech conversion system has been developed, which can generate highly intelligible and natural synthetic speech from an arbitrary text written in Kanji characters (Chinese ideographs) by concatenating CV (C: consonant, V: vowel) and VC speech units. The system consists of a text analysis system and a speech synthesizer, constructed on compact hardware for a personal computer. To generate high quality synthetic speech, a pitch controlled residual wave excitation method is proposed, which uses residual waves as excitation signals for a synthesis filter in all portions of each speech unit. To realize natural rhythms, a phoneme duration rule has been created, based on statistical analysis of a large speech database. Evaluation experiments for the synthesizer were carried out. Results for the 100 syllable articulation test show an 88.8% accuracy rate and results for the 1,000 phonetically balanced word intelligibility test show a 97.4% accuracy.\n",

One is a phoneme segment selection method using an objective continuity measure, and the other is an excitation signal extraction method for pitch and duration control. The continuity measure is expressed using continuity of the LPC spectrum envelopes. When this measure is used for optimum selection, natural sounding synthetic speech is produced without any smoothing technique. For pitch and duration control, an automatic excitation signal extraction method is proposed that also uses the spectral distortion criteria between original and synthetic speech based on residual excited LPC vocoder. When this new pitch and duration control method is used, the average LPC cepstrum distortion (CD) is decreased from 1.90 dB to 1.01 dB.\n",

This paper describes various methods for using inverse-filtered waveforms from natural speech as a voice source in a text-to-speech system. One method uses a repeating loop, and controls pitch by interpolating samples in the waveform. Another method creates a source waveform of the desired pitch by concatenating single pulses from a collection of pulses. Listening tests were carried out to compare these methods with each other and with more traditional voice source generation techniques.

    "Voiced-Unvoiced Classifications of Japanese speech are discussed. Voiced-unvoiced classification of short frames using the criteiria of weighted distance is proposed by Atal [1]. We adopted these methods to the Japanese speech, and reached the conclusion that the bias terms of determinants of the weights are significant for Japanese speech. We propose several mothods with regard to this. We tried several modifications of the Atal's method, and got considerably better results than direct application to Japanese speech data. In these methods it is assumed that the distributions of these parameters have normal distributions, where the Bays-like likelihood ratio tests are efficient. However, when the distributions of the parameters in the unvoiced class are checked precisely, these distributions apparently have two peaks. This breaks the assumption for the Bays-like likelihood ratio tests. The relation between the methods of classifiction and the fact that unvoiced parameters are distributed in two peaks is discussed.\n",

    "This paper describes a new vector-quantization-based phoneme recognition method which uses the hierarchical time spectrum pattern (TSP). The phonetic feature is discussed by a mutual information and a posteriori probability between vector quantization codes and phoneme label codes. The TSP of Mel-scaled LPC cepstra and the power-change pattern (PCP) are used as acoustic parameters. Input speech is firstly vector-quantized by the PCP codebook. Secondly it is vector-quantized by the TSP of which the codebooks are classified by the PCP-VQ code. Hierarchical TSP-VQ improves performance of phoneme classification compared with only the TSP-VQ. A frame-label matching experiment on a speaker-independent condition with the JEIDA Japanese speech database of connected 4-digit uttered by 16 males and 16 females, shows 79.4% of recognition accuracy using the method. The experimental result indicates that the proposed method is highly effective.\n",

    "This paper proposes a new method of recognizing the four tones, the method is based on the functional model for the process of generating F0 contours of sentences, so our method is different from proposed others, it is applied to the four tone recognition not only for monosyllables, but also for disyllables, phrases and even sentences. This method is adaptable to every speaker with a simple training procedure using only \"MA\" four tones. It can recognize the lexical tones using a few parameters. The recognition accuracy is over 99% for monosyllables, 93% for disyllables and idioms of four-syllable.\n",

    "In this paper, we investigate training algorithms of hidden Markov model(HMM) parameters for speech recognition. Here the speech recognition problem is thought of as multicategory hypotheses testing based on the HMM method. The criterion used in a training algorithm is classified into two classes; single and multicategory criterion. We study the maximum likelihood estimation(MLE) and unification estimation(UE) methods which use single category criterion, and the maximum mutual information estimation(MMIE) and corrective estimation(CE) methods which use multicategory criterion. Also, we propose a hybrid method of training and a method of variable weighting to each category. In addition, we compare the performances of these training methods by a confusable-phoneme recognition experiment.\n",

    "A new phoneme recognition method based on Bayesian linear discrimination (BLD) is presented. The conventional BLD lowers the performance as the number of classes to be discriminated becomes larger. To overcome this defect, we propose the pair-wise discrimination method which combines BLDs of the pairs of the classes. A given sample is recognized as the class which is supported or is not denied by most pairs. This method realizes high accuracy recognition but needs much computation and storage. Therefore, an algorithm to select effective pairs for overall discrimination is discussed. To measure the effectiveness of each pair, we count the occurrence of the first candidate and the second candidate combination pairs for all the samples and eliminate those pairs whose occurrence is rare. Thus we could reduce the necessary pairs for discrimination to about one fourth within 1% accuracy decrease.\n",

    "The Wave Analysis Language (WAL) is a functional programming language which is primarily designed to allow rapid writing, testing and modification of speech-to-phonetics recognition rules. WAL has an extremely simple production-rule syntax which is easy for non-programmers to learn and use. The simplicity and innate modularity of the WAL syntax is accompanied by a rich semantic expressive capacity for capturing and combining those features of a speech waveform and various associated signal processing derivations that indicate the presence of whatever phoneme of phonetic class is under consideration.\n",
    "The result of the recognition rule firings can be examined interactively through a flexible signal processing package into which WAL has been embedded. Rules can also be batched to run over a labelled speech database with the rules being run in inverse mode to provide an explanation for mis-firings. Output from WAL can also be produced in the form of a string of phonetic labels which can be considered either with or without time alignment to the original speech waveform. This phonetic string can be passed to other components of a speech recognition or understanding system. Thus WAL is used both as a recognition rule development tool and as an integral component of a large speech recognition/understanding architecture. Rules in WAL can be combined explicitly using the various temporal reasoning primitives provided ('and', 'or', 'not', 'then', 'before', 'after') or implicitly using a context-tree mechanism which allows for hierarchical overwriting. Rules can be either categorical or probabilistic. WAL includes the notion of 'rubber-templates' i.e. a set of primitives for describing shapes and their deformations. This idea, together with the ability to perform temporal reasoning, provides a powerful extension to picture languages and their use in speech recognition. The original version of the language was implemented in Prolog and has now been reimplemented in C. It and the associated signal processing package are now maintained both under MS-DOS and Unix.\n",

    "A Japanese text dictation system has been developed based on phoneme recognition and a dependency grammar. The phoneme recognition is carried out using a modified LVQ2 method proposed. A linguistic processor is composed of a Bunsetsu-unit(Japanese Phrase) spotting processor and a syntactic processor with semantic constraints. In the Bunsetsu-unit spotting processor, using a syntax driven continuous DP matching algorithm the Bunsetsu-units are spotted from a recognized phoneme sequence and then a Bunsetsu lattice is generated. In the syntactic processor, the Bunsetsu lattice is parsed based on the dependency grammar. The dependency grammar is expressed as the correspondence between a FEATURE marker in a modifier-Bunsetsu and a SLOT-FILLER marker in a head-Bunsetsu. Recognition scores of the Bunsetsu-unit and phoneme were 73.2% and 86.1% for 113 sentences uttered by each of two male speakers.\n",

Conventional maximum likelihood estimation method for HMM training has a problem that the recognition performance is not considered in the training procedure. To solve the problem, a corrective training method has been already-proposed, but this method is applied to discrete HMMs, so the trained HMMs cannot avoid undesirable effects of VQ distortion. In this paper, the optimal discriminative training method (ODT) is described, appling the the basic concept of the corrective training to continuous mixture density HMMs, better recognition performance can be obtained as avoiding the VQ distortion. Prom word recognition experiments, we discuss the way to optimize each parameters of this training method, and by using the optimum value of parameters, we show the effectiveness of this method.\n",

In this case, the maximum number of words having the same phonetic labelling is 6. The paper summarises the results of ten different phonetic classification schemes and discusses their implication for a large vocabulary speech recognition system.

For this purpose, vowel-like portions and nonvowel-like portions of the speech signal are segmented first, and different distance measures are applied to each of them. In order to segment input utterance into vowel-like and nonvowel-like intervals, we also propose a segmentation algorithm based on a set of descriptive features derived from the auditory filter bank output. According to our recognition experiments, a reduction of over one third in recognition errors is possible with the proposed method in comparison with the conventional method. This method is particularly useful when a broad phonetic classifier is employed as a front-end stage for reducing the number of candidate words.\n",

The constituent features of the structures are associated with the acoustic realizations through probabilistic measure. In the algorithm, syllable structure is parsed from the acoustic realizations by applying the acoustic-phonological constraints and the collocational restrictions involved in the internal constituent features.

Since more than 90% of the computational load is inner product calculation, the DSPs share a vocabulary for the purpose of load-balancing. The architecture of the accelerator consists of off-the-shelf components connected in such a way for improved performance in the application.

    "In line with the Malaysian Government policy of implementing standard Malay language pronunciation in schools and institutions of higher learning, research on the recognition of spoken Malay language is currently being pursued at the National University of Malaysia.The purpose of this research is to develop a computerised system which can recognize objectively standard Malay language. Uttered Malay words are sampled and broken into phonemes. The voiced and unvoiced phonemes are stored using different parameters. The zero-crossing rate and average magnitude of the signal are used to build the template for the unvoiced phonemes, while the normalized time sampled signal over a selected pitch period and the duration of the phonemes are being used as parameters for the voiced template.In the recognition part, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is used to compare between the voiced template and the input voiced samples. The recognition is done by comparing the sample within the pitch period for the voiced part. However in the case of unvoiced recognition, it is done through the computation of zero-crossing and average magnitude. A database of Malay words is used to compare the recognised words with all the words in the database. A decision as to whether the sound of the uttered word is in accordance with the standard Malay language is achieved through this comparison.Work is actively being undertaken to port the developed system from the IBM PC-AT to the TMS320-based system [1].\n",

    "Surrounding noise seriously affects the performance of speech recognition which can operate under usual noise environment. When we try to make an audio equipment or television set which can be controlled by speech, the sound radiated by the equipment itself also affects the performance of speech recognition. In this study, we propose the method to reduce the latter type noise, a priori known noise. The exponential step normalized LMS algorithm is used for the adaptation of FIR digital filter. Also the method of speech candidate detection is presented using the characteristics of adaptive filter. The experiments are carried out under usual room condition with the several broadcasted sound as noise. The total reduction of noise varies from 15dB to 25dB due to the difference of noise type. There is the correlation between the spectrum of noise and the obtained filter coefficients on adaptive filter.\n",

    "This paper proposes a weighted group delay distance measure (WGD) for noisy speech recognition. The WGD distance measure approximates an absolute group delay spectral distance weighted by the power spectra, which is sensitive to lower formant peaks and insensitive to the global spectral slope variation. The recognition performance of WGD was evaluated through speaker dependent and independent word recognition tests in additive white Gaussian and low-pass filtered noise. The results showed that WGD not only attains significant gains on robustness to additive noise over WLR and RPS, but also maintains the same robustness to interspeaker variation as WLR.\n",

    "A method of processing noisy speech to enhance spectral features corresponding to the vocal tract system is presented. A new method of extracting pitch from noisy speech data is also presented. These methods depend on processing the Fourier transform phase through group delay functions. The basic idea used in these methods is that the features of noise and an all-pole system are distinct in the group delay function. To enhance the spectral features of the vocal tract system a modified group delay function is derived by suppressing the features corresponding to noise from the standard group delay function. Similar ideas are used to extract the periodic component corresponding to pitch from the magnitude spectrum. Performance of these methods is demonstrated for noisy speech data.\n",

    "A new approach of recovering acoustically reverberated signals using Multi-microphone Sub-Band Envelope Estimation (M-SBEE) is proposed. The transfer functions between sound source and microphones have different zero distributions in the z-plane. This method takes the advantage of the differences of the zero distributions by chosing the best behaved microphone for each sub-band, and reconstruct the full band signal using the best microphone in each sub-band. The recovered speech signals using 7 microphones with 256 sub-bands are perfect when the reverberation time(RT) is less than 4.3s, is good enough for RT<0.85s, and is reasonably good for even RT=1.07s. The effects of the number of micro-phones and the size of the microphone array are also discussed.\n",

    "Research involving lexical components of both text-to-speech and recognition systems is of vital importance for their total performance. Lexicons vary in content dependent on the theory behind the systems and their proposed use. For a number of years, we have been working with lexica for different European languages as part of our multi-language text-to-speech project. However, the need for more detailed lexical descriptions is increasing in our projects. We have chosen to base our current efforts on a morphological component, developed at the University of Helsinki. This component, based on many different kinds of corpora, has a very good coverage of running text. The morph dictionary has been transcribed with the help of the KTH text-to-speech system. A partial morphological analysis of native names has proven to be efficient ito predict the pronunciation of names in a telephone directory. We will also report on a project where we have applied knowledge about lexical structure to facilitate lexical search for motorically disabled or non-speaking computer users.\n",

(1) Both a morphological analysis module and a Kana-Kanji conversion module are available to analyze input texts, and the editing module can modify the output of these two modules. (2) The syntactic analysis which is introduced in morphological analysis decreases the number of word candidates, and consequently the system has high performance for selection of correct words.

    "Because of simplification in the realization of both the vocal tract transfer functions and the excitation sources, certain limitations exist in the quality of speech synthesized by conventional terminal analog speech synthesizers. In order to realize high quality synthesis of speech, a new type of terminal analog synthesizer has been developed consisting of four paths of cascade connection of pole/zero filters and three types of source waveform generators. The four separate paths simulate the vocal tract transfer functions of the four different speech categories: the vowels and vowel-like sounds, the nasal murmur and the buzz bar, the frication and the plosion. Configuration of each path has been decided based on the results of analysis of natural utterances. The generators produce voicing source waveforms, white Gaussian noise waveforms, and impulse-like waveforms. The quality of synthesized speech, especially stop consonants, has indicated the advantage of the proposed synthesizer over the conventional ones.\n",

In human speech, however, it has been found that consonantal differences are often cued by the quality of adjacent vowel allophones. This paper will discuss how both the naturalness and intelligibility of consonants can be enhanced by incorporating a large number of vowel allophones into a text-to-speech system.\n",

    "In recent years there has been a growing interest amongst the speech research community into the use of spectral estimators which circumvent the traditional quasi-stationary assumption and provide greater time-frequency (t-f) resolution than conventional spectral estimators, such as the short time Fourier power spectra (STFPS). One distribution in particular, the Wigner distribution (WD), has attracted considerable interest. However, experimental studies have indicated that, despite its improved t-f resolution, employing the WD as the front end of a speech recognition system actually reduces recognition performance; only by explicitly re-introducing t-f smoothing into the WD are recognition rates improved. By re-formulating the spectral estimation problem in terms of a bias variance optimisation task, we provide an explanation for these previous experimental findings.\n",
    "A practical adaptive smoothing algorithm is introduced, which attempts to match the degree of smoothing introduced into the WD with the time varying quasi-stationary regions within the speech waveform. The recognition performance of the resulting adaptively smoothed estimator is found to be comparable to that of conventional interbank estimators, yet the average temporal sampling rate of the resulting spectral vectors is reduced by around a factor of ten.\n",

According to such results, the author discusses the synthesis possibility of various prosody styles, and he remarks that the speech prosody style of the text-reading mode (including the acted conversation style) is easier to be simulate with a simpler rule system, because the speech to be simulated is already regularized when the original speech turned to the literal text and turned again from letters to speech.\n",

    "This paper describes a newly developed Japanese text-to-speech conversion system. The phonetic and prosodic information for speech synthesis is extracted from the input text by the Japanese text analyzer so that Kanji and Kana texts can be input directly to the system. The synthetic speech is generated by concatenating speech synthesis units which contain symmetrical waveforms. As synthesis units, VCV syllables are used as well as CV syllables and symmetrical waveforms have been obtained by PSE analysis. Therefore, the synthetic speech sounds smooth and natural. The system has been built on a compact board which can be housed in a PC slot.\n",

    "In this paper, we describe a neural network based concatenation method of synthesis units for synthesis by rule. In proposed method, two types of multilayer perceptions are used. One is neural network for phoneme recognition, another is for production of spectrum. A recognition network performs mapping a spectrum to a vector of which elements show similarities to each phoneme ( phonetic vector ), and a spectral production network performs inverse transformation of a recognition network. At boundary of synthesis units, two phonetic vectors are calculated using a recognition network, and interpolation between these vectors are performed, then the spectra of interpolation segment are generated by a spectral production network. We provide multiple sets of neural networks for vowels and consonants, and these are trained based on back-propagation algorithm. Using the proposed method, we obtained satisfactory results in realizing coarticulation, and synthetic speech is very natural.\n",

    "We propose here a new parametric model and its application to speech synthesis. In our source-filter model, the source is described by spectro temporal events. The filter combine an all-pole filter model for the vocal tract and a de-emphasis filter corresponding to the lip radiation and glottal spectrum slope. Source events are singular or belong to a continuum or pseudo-continuum of events. Examples of singular events are the burst of noise at release of plosive or isolated glottal pulses. Pseudo-continua of events are quasi periodic glottal pulses with their intrinsic irregularities with possible superimposed fricative noise, or pure noise signals as in unvoiced fricatives. Our model allows for a precise and perceptually satisfying description of speech signal and simultaneously provides more flexibility for prosodic modifications. We present an analysis method according to our model using any spectral estimation technique such as AR or homomorphic estimations. We also present an overlap-add synthesis method using the analysis data. We show that our method can be interpreted in terms of frequency domain spectral interpolation as an ARMA model.\n",

The listening experiments have confirmed that our model produces high quality synthetic speech which is better as compared with synthetic ones using ordinary models.

A new LSP synthesizer which produces a wide frequency band of output speech is developed. The synthesizer is implemented with a general purpose Digital Signal Processor(DSP). Optimum design parameters, such as LSP order, parameter quantization bits are decided on the basis of spectral distortion and preference tests results.

    "Speech synthesisers capable of reproducing high quality male speech from parametric information already exist. The parallel formant synthesiser developed by the Joint Speech Research Unit is recognised as one of the best of these with a real-time, five formant digital signal processor implementation being commercially available. Current research into copy synthesis of female speech shows that the inclusion of further formants is required for the synthesis of realistic female speech. The inherently sequential nature of a digital signal processor implementation limits this extension to the parallel formant synthesiser. The advent of parallel processors and the availability of the Transputer however makes possible a truly parallel highly versatile implementation of a real-time synthesiser, capable of multi-gender speech synthesis. This paper describes the development of such a synthesiser having seven formant resonators. The design of the synthesiser utilised a new technique to overcome the communications \"bottleneck\" associated with the Transputer due to it only having four links. The lack of Transputer links would have proved problematic when performing the resonator data communications and during the passing of the control parameters for each of the resonators of the parallel formant synthesis model. This optimisation technique is also briefly described.\n",

    "This paper addresses the enhancement of human-computer interaction through the synthesis of nonverbal expressions. As a means of improving the naturalness of synthesized speech for the realization of human-computer discourse, study has been focused on the effects of emotion and intention on prosodic features of human speech. Experiments were carried out to observe the time-variant behavior of the fundamental frequency, amplitude, and formant frequencies of nonverbal expressions relative to the intentions and emotional states of the speakers. From the observed data, fundamental relationships were determined and stated in the form of constraints on parameters for a formant synthesizer. Fuzzy inference was used to process these constraints. The method supports the linguistic declaration of constraints in the form of conditionals, and it enables fine-tuning through the adjustment of fuzzy set membership functions.\n",

A pitch contour is computed by converting the descriptors into a sequence of abstract targets whose absolute values depend on a specific speaker model. Duration is determined first at the level of the syllable by a neural network, then accommodated at the segment level according to the distributions observed in a phonetically balanced database. The output waveform is generated by LPC resynthesis of diphone units. Three methods of diphone segmentation are discussed.\n",

    "A novel statistical method is proposed in this paper for synthesizing fundamental frequency (F0-) contour of natural Mandarin speech. By taking advantage of simple tone structure, a statistical model is defined to describe the dependence of F0-contour patterns of monosyllables on phonetical features extracted from input texts. In the training, parameters of the model are empirically estimated from a set of sentential utterances. Phonological rules for synthesis are then automatically extracted from the training utterances and implicitly included in the model. In the test, based on the model, the best sequence of F0-contour pattern is estimated using a Viterbi search for an input sentence. Performance of this method was evaluated by simulation using nine repeats of utterances of 112 declarative sentences spoken bv a single speaker. Experiment results show that 77.56% of synthesized F0-contour patterns of monosyllables coincide with the VQ-quantized versions of the original natural speech. Naturality of the synthesized speech is confirmed by an informal listening test.\n",

    "A pause rule for Japanese text-to-speech conversion technique is proposed, which can determine natural pause locations. In order to insert several pauses at appropriate bunsetsu boundaries (which resemble \"phrase\" boundaries in English), the probabilities (pause insertion probabilities) that words are followed or preceded by pauses are used. The pause insertion probabilities are obtained by statistically analyzing a large number of sentence utterances. It was found that the probabilities differ from each other, according to the parts of speech for the words adjacent to the pauses. By the rule, adequate pauses are inserted at the bunsetsu boundaries whose pause insertion probabilities are high. An evaluation experiment for the rule was carried out, using 200 sentences. The result indicates that the pause locations, determined by the rule, are as natural, in 93% of the sentences, as those determined by humans. The rule is adopted by a Japanese text-to-speech conversion system.\n",

    "Converting a word or a written text from characters to phonemes is one of the first steps done in text-to-speech synthesis. The first part of this process is a text normalization replacing numbers, abbreviations and acronyms, by their full text equivalents. The second step is grapheme to phoneme conversion. Phonetics can also be used to search a file using a phonetic index when the spelling of the name (client file for example) or of the word (look-up in a dictionary) is not certain. In the last case, phonetics can be used to correct spelling mistakes in a text or to find a word in a dictionary without knowing how to write it. A specialized programming language has been designed to write the rules. This allows the rules to be easily defined, revised and expanded independandly of the program (compiler and interpreter). For French, the lastest version consists of approximately 500 rules and is used in different products (synthesizers, CDROM). A different set of rules could be defined for proper names or for other languages: English, Spanish, etc.\n",

    "In this paper, a statistical method to recognize phoneme in continuous speech is presented. Three aspects of the system are discussed. The first problem is speaker adaptation to improve the recognition rate. The second is about the effective calculation of phoneme likelihood, especially for consonants in various phoneme environments. The third is an algorithm to modify a label and to get final phoneme decision from a frame label using a duration and phoneme sequence rule. In the frame level, with a set of 100 words, the correct recognition rate of all phoneme categories reaches to 80.42% in multi-speaker experiment (6 males) and 74.76% in completely speaker independent experiment. And we will show the results obtained from ATR data base with a set of 3271 words of single speaker data in which 1370 words are used for training and 1901 words are used for recognition test.\n",

    "Results are reported of experiments in the use of Charade, an Automatic Learning System, to classify phonetic macro-classes. A preliminary evaluation of the Charade system is carried out on a reference database of continuous speech and compared to an usual classifier (i.e., Hamming Distance Nearest Neighbor) and a neural net based technique (i.e., Modified Hopfied Net). Preliminary results of classification of phonetic macro-classes can be summarized as follows : For a given reasonable error rate, Charade classifier gives the lowest rejection rate. An important advantage of Charade lies in the ability to analyse and interpret the production rules. For instance, a rule can be interpreted in terms of cues relevant to features.\n",

    "This paper discusses the problem of unknown contexts in the training data set, which often arise in the context dependent approach to speech modeling for speech recognition, and gives a solution by a phoneme environment clustering (PEC) algorithm. A context (phoneme environment)-dependent phoneme model approach is supposed to be very helpful both in speech recognition and speech synthesis. However, it introduces a very difficult problem, namely that the variety of contexts is often too large to obtain from the training data and, even if this is possible, the number of samples for each context may be too small to train its HMM phonetic model. PEC is one possible solution to the problem. It is a general framework for handling phoneme context (or, more generally, phoneme environments) which allows arbitrary number of clusters of phoneme varieties or \"acoustic allophones\" in minimization of some total distortion measure. Since it is based on successive binary division of an abstract space, it inherently has the ability to interpolate the unknown contexts. It is described how contextual 'holes' and 'gaps' are interpolated. This ability is proved through pattern prediction experiments and evaluation by a separability measure. This scheme is tested by an HMM-based phoneme recognition experiment on 5240-words, half of which were used for training and the other half for testing. The results have shown that the recognition error rate is reduced from 9.4% by 25 phoneme models to 3.1% using the PEC with 256 clusters.\n",

    "We propose an original knowledge based approach of acoustic-phonetic decoding of continuous speech relying on the use of triplets: a phone with its phonetic context. A triplet is made up of two description levels: an acoustic description in terms of acoustic 'events (formant, burst ...) and an expert component which indicates the significant acoustic correlates to recognize a triplet. The matching process is firstly performed at the acoustic level, results are then weighted with the help of the expert component. As triplet are phone prototypes it is possible to extract acoustic relations between two reference triplets. These relations must be simultaneously satisfied between two triplet instances of the unknown sentence and two reference triplets proposed as solution. Relaxation techniques enable to implement this idea in order to increase consistency of the global solution.\n",

These spectrograms are created using a filter banks an inner hair cell (IHC) model and a lateral inhibition (LINH) circuit, in different combinations. Eight different filter banks of three different types of filter are prepared: (1) a simple band pass filter with Qb=4.5 and 30, (2) a conventional fixed Q cochlear filter with Qb-4.5 and 30, and (3) an adaptive Q cochlear filter with feedback/feedforward control with short/long adaptation time constant. Each filter bank is composed of 55 channel filters spaced by 1/3 Bark and spanning the frequency range from 1 to 18.7 Bark. The IHC model involves a saturated half wave rectifier and a short term adaptation circuit. The recognition task is to classify input tokens into 18 phoneme categories using 5,788 training tokens and 5,773 testing tokens. Results are as follows; (1) The adaptive Q cochlear filter with LINH gives better recognition performances than the other types of filter banks in all training/testing conditions. (2) The LINH effectively improves recognition performance. (3) The IHC model produces no benefit even for the noisy data set.\n",

    "This paper is concerned with the effects of different pausing strategies on word recognizability in less than optimal, connected synthetic speech. The main hypothesis behind the experiments to be described is that human recognition of poor quality speech can be improved by inserting well formed speech pauses at appropriate positions within sentences. This hypothesis was tested with fifteen syntactically and semantically well formed Dutch sentences, each 36 words and 68. syllables long, and realized by diphone concatenation, with appropriate synthetic sentence melodies. There were four stimulus conditions, viz.: 1) No pauses at all, 2) five pauses at syntactically motivated positions, 3) five pauses immediately preceding informative content words, and 4) five pauses at fixed intervals of six words each. Realizations of all versions of each sentence were given the same overall duration. Each sentence was listened to by 1O listeners in a blocked design involving 4O listeners in total. Each listener had a form giving away the function words of each sentence and was asked to fill in the content words. Main results are the following: a) Syntactically motivated pause positions lead to higher recognition scores than any of the other conditions. b) Words immediately preceding pauses profit much more from syntactically motivated pauses and suffer much more from ill placed pauses in their recognition scores than any other words. c) Monosyllables profit and suffer much more from well placed and ill placed pauses respectively than longer words.\n",

    "Speech has two aspects: one is phonetic feature and the other is prosodic feature. The role of prosody in the cognitive process of spoken language has been studied. Prosody consists of three kinds of prosodic features, namely pitch, amplitude and temporal structures. Among them, this study focuses on temporal structure, including pausing and phoneme duration. Perceptual experiments based on word detection tests have been performed. The stimuli were excitation source signals composed of pulse trains and white noise that included no spectral information. The experimental results suggest that a continuous rhythm of spoken language, which consists of not only pausing information but also phonemic duration, plays an important role in word detection. Still more, pausing information, including the silence just before the burst in a word-initial plosive, contributes to phrase or word segmentation. On spoken language understanding, these temporal cues assist in the word recognition, combined with the context information in various levels of speech perception.\n",

    "Spoken words depend on their linguistic context to be identified in fluent speech. We examined whether contextual dependence varied with the level of information conveyed by a word. In particular, we compared the intelligibility of closed-class vs. open-class words and of given vs. new discourse information. If speakers articulate most clearly words that provide the greatest information, then open-class words and new discourse information should be less dependent on context. Words were excised from conversational speech and presented to listeners for identification. Closed-class words were accurately identified significantly less often than open-class words and open-class words expressing given information were identified significantly less often than those expressing new information. Results can be attributed to the clarity of articulation of each segment in a word rather than to greater coarticulation between word boundaries for the less informative words. Furthermore, results cannot be attributed solely to focal stress. The results are interpreted as driven by a speaker's notions about what is functionally communicative.\n",

    "Experiments were conducted to investigate lexical and coarticulatory effects on phoneme processing in relation to the word recognition point. Real Japanese words and non-words all containing /k/ at various positions were presented to six subjects as naturally spoken or as synthesized by the concatenation of moras. Reaction times for /k/ in the words and for lexical decisions of the words were individually measured. A recognition point for each word was estimated from the time required to make a lexical decision. The results showed that the reaction times for /k/ in real words were the same for nonwords before the point preceding the word recognition point by about 300 ms. However, after this point, the reaction times for /k/ in real words was shorter than in nonwords. The results were the same for naturally-spoken words and concatenated words. Therefore, this facilitatory effect on phoneme processing is due to the use of lexical information and not coarticulatory information, and this lexical facilitation is effective even before a word is fully recognized.\n",

Four groups of subjects were presented with both lists of words for familiarity judgements. The first group (W), saw all the words on each list presented visually; the second group (AA) heard all the words; the third and fourth groups (AV, VA) received one list visually and another list auditorily. Subjects rated the familiarity of each word using a seven-point scale. Correlations of the familiarity scores across both lists and modalities were very high. The mean ratings were not significantly different for visual and auditory groups. The absence of modality differences suggests that familiarity effects occur late in the processing system where information from the input modality converges on a common lexical store in long-term memory.\n",

    "Listeners hearing distorted speech may be able to \"correct\" it if they have enough information about the nature of the distortion. We present evidence that this ability to correct a distorted speech signal is bought at a slight cost, namely, hyper-correction. We presented American English listeners with brief (85 msec) samples of 11 vowels that had been 1 kHz low-passed filtered. When presented in a way that gave them no chance to learn the filter characteristics they made 33.3% correct identifications. Many of the errors involved front vowels (those having a high Formant 2) being confused with back vowels (which often have F2 and F1 fused at 1 kHz or less). When the samples were preceded by a redundant precursor sentence filtered in the same way as the vowel samples, listeners raised their correct identifications to 50.1% but there was an increase in \"hyper-correction\" errors, i.e., where back vowels were identified as front vowels. This may provide clues as to how listeners \"correct\" distorted signals.\n",

In addition, more recent studies have shown that speech recognition is not carried out by a fixed perceptual system: Perceptual learning of speech takes place even in adult listeners. In spite of these findings, most theories of speech perception do not incorporate mechanisms of learning or attention. Perhaps the absence of these mechanisms may explain why theories of speech perception have been unable to provide a sufficient account of our ability to recognize the linguistic structure of spoken language. Recent research suggests that a linkage between perceptual learning and attention may provide the basis for a new, cognitive theory of speech perception that can explain our ability to understand spoken language.\n",

In order to overcome its empirical shortcomings, McClelland (in press) modified the interactive activation to be stochastic rather than deterministic and to use a best one wins (BOW) decision rule. When tested against real data and contrasted with the FLMP, however, the new stochastic IAC (SIAC) model gives a poorer description of the joint influence of stimulus information and context in perception. Interactive activation is both inconsistent with empirical results and not necessary to describe the joint influence of stimulus information and context in language perception.\n",

    "Three-dimensional vocal tract shapes have been studied using the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR Images of 24 horizontal sections from the larynx to the nasal cavity at 0.6-cm intervals, were measured during steady-state productions of Japanese vowels. The measurement time was 123 second. Configurations of the area interior to the horizontal vocal tract were extracted manually from the horizontal MR images by using digitizer, and three-dimensional vocal tract shapes were obtained from the 24 areas of horizontal vocal tract. Curvature functions of the mid-sagittal tongue shape and cross-sectional areas interior to the vocal tract, were estimated from the three-dimensional vocal tract data. Based on the observation, a three-dimensional vocal tract model that estimate the vocal tract area function from 2 positions on frontal tongue surface, was proposed for natural speech synthesis. The vocal tract model consist of articulatory models for the midsagittal tongue shape and for cross-sectional area interior to the vocal tract. Vowels were synthesized by model parameters adaptation of the 2 positions on frontal tongue shape. Time courses of the formant frequency for the synthesized vowels, agreed with one for the subjects' original productions. The results indicate the usefulness of the proposed models based on the observation of the three-dimensional vocal tract shape.\n",

    "In this paper the characteristics of sound pressure distribution in the vocal tract are described on the basis of acoustic measurement. The measurement was performed with plaster replicas of the oral cavity. The validity of plane wave propagation is examined from the measured spatial distribution of the amplitude and phase of sound pressure for pure tone. It is shown that at certain frequencies, there exist points where sound pressure is absolutely zero, with the phase spatially circulating around them. A simple model is considered to explain this phenomenon. And up to about 4kHz except at these certain frequencies, the wave front is almost 1-dimensional though an amplitude gradient can be seen in the vertical direction. This paper also presents the characteristics of particle trajectories and of sound intensity fields.\n",

    "This paper describes a speech production model considering the factors such as velum impedance, vocal tract volume inflation, and subglottal system. Based on our measurements of acoustic waveforms and mechanical vibrations at several points of vocal organ, we propose a speech production model having oral-nasal coupling through velum even when it closes. The velum is assumed to be composed of two vibrating plates connected each other by a spring and a mechanical resistance. A syllable /bi/ is synthesized and examined, as an example, by the model considering the velum leakage as well as small inflation of vocal tract volume by inner air pressure at just before mouth opening. As to the speech production model which has both of subglottal structure and supraglottal one, it is shown that the wave-form of glottal flow is changed, and synthesized vowels have zeros in their spectra because of an interaction between sub- and supra-glottal structures through small opening area due to incomplete vocal cords closure.\n",

Image data of lip movements were recorded by a high-speed video recorder system at a frame rate of 5 ms, for two male subjects. Sampled images with gray-levels were processed to detect contours of upper and lower lips, which were approximated by a 4-th degree polynomial function with five coefficients. These coefficients, as well as geometric configuration parameters (mouth\" opening area, vertical and horizontal width of mouth, etc.), were adopted as characteristic parameters describing lip articulatory behaviors. Various shapes of lip contour were taken in the combination of individual polynomial coefficient.

    "Sternohyoid activity involving accentual contrast was examined in a male speaker of Tokyo Japanese. The contrast of interest was in the initial position of sentence frames; thus, unaccented vs. accented pairs of two-mora meaningful words were compared in terms of pitch movements and electro- myographic activity. The utterance types all showed such activity preceding the audio onset. For words with accent, this activity became still for a short period and was followed by consistent reactivation; moreover, the mean level of this pre-audio activity was lower for one type of utterances with initial accent. On the other hand, words with no accent showed a different timing for the offset of the pre-audio activity. These findings lend support to the role played by the sternohyoid muscle in pitch lowering, and specifically in the accentual distinction in Japanese.\n",

    "The speaker independence and the context modelling are the key problems in automatic segmentation and alignment of continuous speech, which are connected with the segmental concept of speech. In this paper, a new approach is presented: a robust speaker-independent algorithm for this task. It aligns a phonetic transcription with a phoneme nucleus detector using the temporal decomposition (TD) paradigm. The algorithm performs this task in 3 stages: a) Predetection of phoneme nuclei centers candidates using an adaptive detection window; b) Time-alignment of the corresponding phonetic transcription using a TD model based Dynamic Time Warping (TD-DTW) procedure; c) Adjustment of these output nuclei centers and phoneme boundaries detection based also on the TD model. A new temporal decomposition technique was developed also. This algorithm has been trained using 200 sentences pronounced by one speaker and tested using 50 sentences pronounced by 7 speakers. On the test corpus, 86% of the phonemes nuclei centers candidates fall into one manual segment alone. 94% of the final nuclei centers match the manual segmentation.\n",

The database in this study is composed of five sentences spoken by 5 male and 5 female speakers. Each sentence was uttered twice by each speaker in a sound-treated room. (Almost all kinds of Korean unvoiced sounds are contained in these sentences.) One classification technique is based on the Neural Network utilizing the spectral and the time domain features such as spectral slope, energy, zero-crossing rate, and the autocorrelation coefficient at unit sample delay. The other adopts the conventional pattern classification technique, and uses almost the same features as above. Final classification accuracy of 96.2 % is achieved for both methods. Finally, the results are compared and possible future extensions are briefly discussed.\n",

In this paper, we describe an event based pitch detector which overcomes the above mentioned problems. We estimate the pitch period by detecting the glottal closure, which we label here as an event, using a time-scale representation viz., the Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) and by measuring the time interval between two such events. We illustrate the applicability of this pitch detector to a wide range of pitch periods i.e. for both low pitched and high pitched speakers and its robustness to noise with various examples. We then highlight the merits and demerits of this method by comparing it with existing pitch detection methods. The results of this study indicate that the algorithm works well for noise free and noisy vowels as well as voiced consonants.\n",

    "Analysis using short frame length is necessary in order to realize correct tracking of time-varying features of quasi-periodic signals such as speech. However, when the frame length is reduced for the analysis of rapidly changing signal characteristics, the analysis results are strongly affected by the position of the frame and sometimes may lead to gross errors. In the pitch extraction schemes using the conventional definition of the short-time autocorrelation function, the value of its peak indicating the fundamental period varies with the frame position. In order to reduce these variations, we present a new definition for the normalized shorttime autocorrelation function that does not require the selection of frame length. A new scheme for pitch extraction of speech is proposed that assures high accuracy of results without adjusting the frame length for each speaker. The validity of the proposed scheme is confirmed by the experiments using speech materials recorded by both male and female radio announcers.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a spectral interpolation method using a distortion geodesic line, which is defined as the curve with minimal accumulated distortion. We apply the distortion geodesic line to interpolation of two given spectra (vectors). The first part of this paper describes the definition of the distortion geodesic line. It is shown that a geodesic line is characterized by the Riemannian metric which is introduced as a bilinear form of the second partial derivatives of a given distortion measure. The second part describes an inequality for the WLR measure on several interpolating curves. This inequality guarantees that the accumulated WLR distortion value for any two given spectra, F0 and F1, on the correlation interpolation curve, is always smaller than the direct WLR value dWLR(F0, F1). This property is easily extended to a category of several distortion measures. The third part describes an application of the distortion geodesic line to spectral interpolation, and numerically shows that the interpolation line on the correlation parameter is the best of several kinds of LPC based parameters.\n",

We have been conducting three types of analysis: analysis of dialogue structure, auditory (prosodic) analysis, and acoustic-phonetic analysis. Dialogue structure analysis concerns textual, interactive and turn taking aspects. The auditory analysis takes the form of a transcription encoding five prosodic features: prominence, phrasing, pitch range, boundary tones and pausing. The acoustic-phonetic analysis is centered around pitch, particularly the use of overall pitch range for the expression of textual coherence and boundary of a dialogue. For the modelling of dialogue prosody we have been using rule synthesis. Our preliminary testing shows that variation in pitch range is a potentially important means for signalling textual aspects of a dialogue.\n",

    "This paper focuses on a partial emphasis process in sentences known as \"prominence\". Prominence is considered important in achieving rule-based synthetic speech that is easily understood. In general, prominence in Japanese sentences may be divided into two types, default and intended. Intended prominence can be further classified depending on where focus is placed. Features of Japanese sentences which include both types of prominence are analyzed in terms of prosody. The analysis results show that the most dominant form of prominence is enhancement of fundamental frequency and increasing of power. Specifically, this analysis concerning F0 contours confirms that a syntactic unit or a part of it, as an object of placed focus, is mapped into one of several categories of prosodic words and variation types. Finally, listening test results are briefly presented to show the effectiveness of the rules proposed based on the above analysis results.\n",

    "This paper describes our research directed towards the quantification and use of prosodic cues in the intonation contours for different types of queries found in human/machine problem-solving dialogues. We ask three fundamental questions: First, what factors determine intonation encoding for queries? Second, how do these factors interact? Third, what are the implications for speech understanding? Our analysis is based on a corpus of spontaneous speech, containing several thousand sentences, collected in conjunction with the development of the MIT voyager urban exploration and navigation system, under simulated human/machine dialogues. In our corpus, we found that over 90% of the WH-questions, such as Where is MIT, have low final boundary tones. For the YES-NO questions, such as Is there a bank near Harvard, on the other hand, only about 64% were found to have high final boundary tones. Our results, based on classification and regression tree analyses (CART), indicate that, while syntactic structure is the most important factor in predicting intonation contours, other factors such as the sentence's main verb and the speaker's sex are also important. We performed perceptual experiments in which subjects were asked to rate the appropriateness of a simple yes-no answer on a 10-point scale. Our results confirm that listeners vary their judgments of YES-NO appropriateness based on factors other than final boundary tone.\n",

    "This paper discusses the reality and relevance of the prosodic unit 'mora' in Japanese in a cross-linguistic perspective. The main lines of evidence to be discussed are taken from the following three linguistic phenomena: (a) word formation, (b) speech errors, and (c) stuttering. Careful analyses of these phenomena in Japanese reveal that the mora plays an important role as a unit of phonological length, i.e. as a unit for measuring phonological distance in various types of linguistic phenomena. This finding contrasts with the situation in English where essentially the same role is played by the syllable.\n",

    "This paper presents a unified approach to the description and classification of prosodic phenomena in continuous speech, and evaluates its applicability to interpreting telephony for a limited transfer task between equivalent samples of Japanese and English dialogue. An algorithm is proposed which uses the F0 tracings of connected speech dialogue as input and performs speaker independent segmentation into prosodically defined information units. The time- alignment of these units with linguistic structure is established separately for each language, which permits both monolingual classification and bilingual comparison of the prosodic data. A tentative set of transfer roles for the \"translation\" of prosodic features between Japanese and English is introduced, and directions for further research are indicated.\n",

Listening tests were conducted using material collected from three different genres of speech, both with pauses intact and with pauses removed. The results indicate that pauses are indispensable for listeners as a rehearsal time for the short-term memory and therefore play an important role not only for the speaker, but also for the listeners.\n",

Transitional LSP frequency parameters defined by regression coefficients of LSP frequencies are also introduced. The transitional and the instantaneous parameters and distances are linearly combined for better recognition performance. The cepstral distance measures, and transitional and instantaneous cepstral parameters and distances are used for the comparison of the performances.

Then global features are incorporated by making use of the correlations between segments. On a data base with a vocabulary of 212 words spoken by 20 speakers (10 male and 10 female), the system shows higher performance in recognition accuracy and processing speed than the system using whole-word template based dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm.\n",

    "This paper presents an approximation to the recognition of Spanish digits based on a phonetic approach using probabilistic functions of Markov chains. The way to incorporate the phonetic knowledge to the markovian modelling resides on the strong sensitivity of the models to the initial conditions. Continuous PDF's, associated with each state allowed to represent the segments of least variability with greater weight than the others, and in the recognition stage assign more discriminative power to the phonetic relevant segments. The material under study consisted of the ten Spanish digits recorded from two utterances of 28 native male speakers, for a total of 560 words to recognize. The recognition accuracy of 99.64% confirm that the use of phonetic knowledge in the training step of the system allowed to define high discrimination states which favored the recognition. This type of training allowed to obtain an attractive relation of performance vs. complexity of the model.\n",

    "This paper proposes a new word-recognition method based on the Structured Transition Networks (STN) with phonetic segments. Phonetic segments are multiple phonological units which consist of about 600 acoustic/phonetic structures of 32~96 msec duration. The STNs are state transition networks composed of a main path which represents a standard speech pattern and branches which represent distorted patterns. A flexible representation of speech fluctuation using these branches realizes a high rejection performance. The network design with the acoustic/phonetic knowledge requires a smaller amount of training data than do other statistical approaches. An evaluation of 16 spoken words uttered by 10 unknown speakers has achieved a recognition rate of 93.1%, and a rejection rate of 92.5% for the utterances outside the vocabulary.\n",

    "This paper describes an HMM-based speaker-independent word spotting system and its Transputer-based implementation. The candidates of word end-points and the corresponding likelihood scores are computed with the continuous Viterbi decoding algorithm. To prune unreasonable candidates, a new duration control method, a threshold logic for the likelihood scores and a new local peak detection method are proposed. An efficient parallel processing scheme for the word spotting system is carried out by using a tree structure of Transputers. In each frame period, the spectral feature vector from the speech analyzer is broadcasted from the root Transputer (Processing Master: PM) to the node Transputers (Processing Element : PE). Each PE performs the continuous Viterbi decoding and the pruning of candidates in parallel, and the spotting results are returned to PM. With 8 PEs in a tree structure, 72 words can be processed within a 12msec frame period. Word detection experiments, using the 10 Japanese digits spoken over a noisy telephone network, yield a word detection accuracy of 97%.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a dedicated architecture for the Viterbi scoring in hidden Markov model(HMM)-based real-time isolated word recognition systems. Since, in HMM, most states are connected to only three or fewer preceding states, the state transition matrix is very sparse and upper diagonal. Using this property of HMM, we design an efficient Viterbi scoring architecture. The proposed architecture is constructed using either of two types of processing elements (PEs); one can process efficiently most HMM topologies that are being used in practice with a very simple hardware structure, and the other is designed to cover almost all of the possible HMM topologies at an additional hardware cost. Each PE processes, one trellis stage. The PEs can be cascaded to process several consecutive trellis stages in pipeline, thus the memory I/O bandwidth requirement is relaxed significantly. The proposed PEs are implemented in the digit-serial fashion. Thus, the hardware cost of the circuit and the pin count for off-chip I/O is kept to a minimum. Also, since the operators are pipelined fully at digit-level, higher throughput can be obtained.\n",

    "This paper describes a new technique for isolated word recognition that uses both pitch information and spectral information. Words with similar phonetic features tend to be misrecognized in conventional methods which use only spectral information, even if their phonemes are accented differently. Many phonetically-similar Japanese words are classified by pitch patterns. This paper introduces a measure of the pitch pattern distance. A pitch pattern template is produced by averaging pitch patterns obtained from a set of words which have the same accent pattern. A measure for word recognition is proposed, based on a combination of the pitch pattern distance and the phonetic likelihood. Speaker-dependent word recognition experiments were carried out using 216 Japanese words uttered by five male and five female speakers. The proposed measure reduces the recognition error rate by 40% compared with the conventional phonetic likelihood.\n",

    "Two experiments were conducted to examine the distribution of perceptual cues for Japanese intervocalic stop consonants, with a special interest in the perceptual role of the pre-closure portion for Japanese listeners. In Experiment 1, as predicted by Japanese phonological structure, Japanese listeners could not identify stop consonants correctly when only pre-closure portions of vowel-consonant-vowel(VCV) utterances were presented . However, in Experiment 2, despite the apparent ineffectiveness, the pre-closure portion demonstrated strong effects for place perception of intervocalic stop consonants. In natural VCV utterances, even when the release burst and most of the CV formant transitions were replaced by a louder white noise, nearly 90% of original consonants were clearly \"heard\" under the noise. On the other hand, without VC coarticulation, only about a half of original consonants were restored. Moreover, when a preclosure and a post-closure of different intervocalic stops were spliced together, the pre-closure dominated the consonant restoration as the noise duration increases. These results suggest that Japanese listeners can utilize cues for Japanese intervocalic stop consonants that occur not only after the closure, but which are also distributed in the region before and after it.\n",

The estimated dispersion width for a physically identical stimulus pair was smaller when the standard was a typical realization of the phoneme /b/ for each group than when it was atypical. Thus, even in a discrimination task within a category, the difference in the phonological system results in some behavioral differences. These behavioral differences are discussed in relation to a long term memory factor, or an internal prototype which may be involved in auditory information processing of speech sounds.\n",

    "This paper presents two models of contextual effects which can cope with co-articulation problems, especially vowel neutralization. Model 1 predicts target spectral peaks in reduced vowels based on interactions between spectral peak pairs. Model 2 distorts a spectral pattern space to pull back reduced spectral patterns into each of their correct categories based on influences of preceding spectral patterns on phoneme boundaries in a spectral pattern space. To construct two models and to substantiate these models, two psychoacoustic experiments were carried out which measured the extent of phoneme boundary shift with (1) a single formant stimulus as a preceding anchor and (2) a vowel as a preceding anchor. The results from experiment 1 showed that the contextual effect between single formant stimuli should play an important role in phoneme neutralization recovery, and that the neutralization recovery model is formulated as the sum of the contextual effects resulting from interaction between spectral peaks. Additionally, a comparison of the results of the first and second experiments showed that a phoneme boundary shift with a vowel anchor can be considered the sum of a shift with a single formant anchor and a factor from the preceding stimulus. This factor was represented as a function of the distance between the preceding vowel anchor and the perceived vowel in a phoneme space.\n",

Two experiments were conducted to investigate (1) the vowel-contingent effect in the anchoring effect upon the perception of voiced stop consonants and (2) the duration of vowel-contingent anchoring effects. Anchors were presented to fifteen subjects as a part of the stimulus series in Experiment 1 and to five subjects as a preceding stimulus to one of the stimulus series in Experiment 2. Two conditions of interstimulus interval between anchor and target were employed: 1.0 s and 3.0 s. The vowel-contingent anchoring effect was obtained in both of the presentation conditions. More effetcs were obtained when the acoustical similarity between the anchor and stimulus series increased. It was also found that the vowel-contingent anchoring effect decreased when the ISI was 3.0 s. The present results suggest that vowel-contingent anchoring effects occur at the auditory level irrespective of their phonetic code.\n",

    "Connectionist models offer an alternative frame-work to existing process models for the study of speech perception. The empirical domain consists of the integration of auditory and visual speech in bimodal speech perception. Two classes of connectionist models of speech perception have been evaluated and tested. The classes are interactive-activation models and feed- forward models. Empirical results indicate that while several sources of information simultaneously influence speech perception, these representations of the sources remain independent of one another. This independence is strong evidence against interactive activation in speech perception. Performance in speech identification experiments can be described adequately by a connectionist model with only input and output layers. Given the similarities between this model and a successful process model, we currently have two adequate theories of speech perception by human observers.\n",

    "Phoneme detection experiments, in which listeners' response time to detect a phoneme target is measured, have typically used consonant targets. This paper reports two experiments in which subjects responded to vowels as phoneme detection targets. In the first experiment, targets occurred in real words, in the second in nonsense words. Response times were long by comparison with consonant targets, and error rates were high. Targets in initial syllables were responded to much more slowly than targets in second syllables. Full vowels were responded to faster and more accurately than reduced vowels in real words, but not in nonwords. Vowel duration correlated negatively with response time. We conclude that the process of phoneme detection in English is more difficult for vowels than for consonants, and vowels in words are relatively likely to be responded to on the basis of a lexical representation. We speculate that vowel detection may be less difficult in languages with sparser vowel distributions than English.\n",

    "In order to clarify the characteristics of frequency normalization on voiceless consonants in which the frequency axes were compressed or expanded, perceptual experiments were carried out for voiceless fricatives and voiceless stops. For voiceless fricatives, a series of fricative noises that varied from the center frequency appropriate for /// to one appropriate for /s/ were synthesized as stimuli. These stimuli were subjected to a listening test to determine the phonetic categorical boundary between //a/ and /sa/ on the continuum of the noise frequency for various frequency-compression or expansion rates. For voiceless stops, noise part was simulated by either a single-pole noise or a multiple-pole noise. A series of noises that varied from /k/ to /t/ were synthesized and subjected to a identification test between /ka/ and /ta/. The results showed that the categorical boundaries between //a/ and /sa/ were invariant, but the categorical boundaries between /ka/ and /ta/ moved in relation to the frequency-compression or expansion rate for both noise conditions. These results implied that the frequency normalization was made on voiceless stops but not on voiceless fricatives.\n",

    "The width of ear's temporal window and the values of VOT at the phoneme boundary between voiced versus unvoiced consonants in CV (/ba-pa/) and VCV (/aba-apa/) stimuli were measured for 7 normals and 6 sensori-neural hearing-impaired subjects. The measurements were made at the most comfortable level for each of the hearing-impaired subject, and at three levels, 40, 60 and 80 dB SPL for the normal hearing subjects. The temporal window was generally wider for the hearing-impaired subjects than for the normal subjects. The VOT phoneme boundary was longer for the VCV than for the CV contex-ts. The VOT phoneme boundary in the VCV context tended to correlate to the width of the temporal window. Based on these results, we concluded that the poor temporal resolution of the ear affects to some extent the VOT perception for the hearing-impaired subjects.\n",

    "Characteristics of articulatory movements and. pitch control were investigated in the realization of Japanese word accent for a patient with apraxia of speech. Japanese meaningful words beginning with [ai] which have an upward pitch transition at the end of the initial mora were uttered at normal (5.0 mora/s) and slow (3.3 mora/s) speaking rates by a patient with apraxia of speech and five normal controls. Formant trajectories for the initial vowel sequence and pitch contour were extracted and analyzed based on the models proposed by Fujisaki [1], The results for the patient indicated marked delay of pitch control relative to articulatory movements for the slow speaking rate, and shortening of duration of pitch transition in proportion to the delay of initiation of pitch control. A positive correlation of amplitude of accent command with duration of pitch transition was observed for both normal subjects and the patient with apraxia of speech. The correlation indicates compensatory control of amplitude of accent command in order to produce sufficient upward pitch shift against the gradual fall of the voicing component of pitch contour.\n",

    "This paper describes an evaluation of an in-the-ear hearing aid, the ReSound model ED2, which applies fast-acting compression independently in two frequency bands. This can compensate for the loudness recruitment typically associated with sensorineural hearing loss. The crossover frequency between the two bands, and the gain and compression ratio in each band are programmable to suit the individual patient. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) in 12-talker babble were measured for six subjects with moderate sensorineural hearing loss under monaurally and binaurally aided conditions, with the speech and babble both coincident and spatially separated. The ED2 programmed as a two-band compressor gave better speech intelligibility (lower SRTs) than the ED2 programmed as a linear amplifier, and also than unaided listening. A significant advantage for binaural aiding was found, and this advantage was greater when the speech and noise were spatially separated.\n",

Maximum repetition rate (MRR) decreased as a function of age, while articulatory jitter (AJ) , syllable-to- syllable variations in duration which was applied as an index of the irregularity, showed no significant differences. The effect of bite-block was significant for both MRR and AJ. Larger size of BB was associated with smaller MRR and larger AJ.

    "In the present study, the acoustic properties of the vowel quantity contrast in the Seoul variety of Korean were investigated. Acoustic measurements included the duration and fundamental frequency of the vowels, and the frequencies of the first two formants of a-vowels of test words. Perception tests were also carried out with manipulated stimuli. The purpose was to ascertain to what extent listeners from Seoul and Busan, where the tone contrast is substituted for the quantity contrast, could distinguish between two words contrasted in the vowel quantity in a frame with neither semantic nor syntactic cues. In the acoustic analysis it was found that the vowel quantity contrast in the Seoul variety is manifested primarily by differences in vowel duration and sencondarily by differences in formant structure. The perception experiment revealed that a majority of the Seoul and Busan listeners could discriminate between the words contrasting minimally by the quantity of the vowel in the Seoul variety. The positive effect of vowel duration on the perception of the quantity contrast was observed for the listeners from both Seoul and Busan.\n",

The system is composed of texts and laser disc software which form the basis for the systematic study of pronunciation, from single vocabulary items to dialogs, and an analyzer hardware system which subjects the student's pronunciation to computer voice analysis, allowing visual and aural checking of accuracy. Both the learning materials and the analyzer hardware are appropriate for use in language labs as well as for independent study. The system is organized so that it can be used effectively by students at all levels, from junior high school to college and private language schools.

    "This paper proposes a method for enhancing the performance of Codebook-Excited Linear Predictive (CELP) coders. It is based on the observation that the codebook-driven excitation in these coders is noisy and that the noisy component is not adequately filtered by the LPC filter. It is proposed to adaptively constrain the amount of the noisy excitation by linking its level to a performance index of the long-term (pitch-loop) sub-system. This operation reduces the noisy effects of the excitation, enhances the synthesized speech periodicity and hence, the perceptual quality of the coder. Listening test results are presented to demonstrate the subjective improvement of this coder over the basic CELP. The CSEC technique has been implemented in various AT&T coders at 4.8 to 8.0 Kbps, including low-delay CELP, with both stochastic and trained codebooks. Noticeable improvement in speech quality has been achieved. The technique has also been incorporated in the proposed federal standard PFS1016 4.8 Kbps coder.\n",

As original MDCT is defined to have a fixed block size for realizing time domain aliasing cancellation, a new overlap window set is introduced to enable variable block size existence, in ATC-ABS. In addition to MDCT employment, a new adaptive bit assignment algorithm based on the auditory characteristic is also introduced to prevent distortion by deficiency of assigned quantization bit amount. In the results of paired comparison tests, the original signals and the reproduced signals by the proposed algorithm are preferred by more than 40% of the subjects, while the reproduced signal by ATC-ABS is preferred by less than 10% of the subjects. The proposed method is promising for digital recording media and for digital communications.\n",

    "A medium bit-rate (8 kbit/s), medium delay (10 msec one-way), and high-quality speech coder is designed. The coder uses a conditional pitch predictor in the framework of the backward adaptive CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction) coder. This scheme transmits only 3 to 5 bits to select from the pitch period candidates pruned by backward pitch analysis. It also uses block-wise backward adaptive short-term LPC analysis and backward adaptive gain quantization. In coding experiments, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and subjective quality were superior to schemes with conventional forward pitch prediction or without pitch prediction. Although the quality of the proposed coder is slightly inferior to that of the conventional forward CELP (more than 50 ms delay) at the same bit-rate, it can outperform conventional CELP if delayed decision of the excitation vector is introduced by paying a computational cost.\n",

    "In this paper, an efficient variable transmission frame length (VTFL) speech coding method is proposed and its performance is studied by computer simulation. The proposed speech coding method is based on the idea that the performance of speech coding would be improved by varying the transmission frame length according to the stationarity of input speech signal and vector quantizing the representative feature vector of the transmission frame. In the proposed speech coding method, the feature vector sequence consists of PARCOR coefficient vectors obtained by analyzing input speech signal sample-by-sample using the prewindowed recursive least square lattice algorithm. We take the segmentation from the input speech signal and then determine the representative PARCOR vector in each segment. By joining the consecutive segments of phonetically similar characteristics using the likelihood ratio distortion measure, we can obtain transmission frames of variable length. From the computer simulation results, the proposed VTFL speech coding method yields the reduction of total transmission bit rate while maintaining the good reproduced speech quality.\n",

    "The Neural Prediction Model (NPM) is a speech recognition model designed to consider the correlation between spectral and temporal structures in the speech patterns, which are important for accurate speech recognition. This paper presents an improvement in the model and its application to large vocabulary speech recognition, based on subword units. The improvement involves an introduction of \"backward prediction,\" which further improves the prediction accuracy of the original model with only \"forward prediction\". In application of the model to large vocabulary speech recognition, the demi-syllable unit is used as a subword recognition unit. Speaker dependent large vocabulary speech recognition experiments were carried out. The training data amount, necessary for model parameter estimation, and the input layer configuration for pattern predictors were examined. As the best result, a 94.8% recognition accuracy for a 5000 word test set was obtained and the effectiveness was confirmed for the proposed model improvement and the demi-syllable units.\n",

Extra results obtained after having split our corpus into vowels and consonants are also reported. Experiments are conducted on a set of 5270 phonemes extracted from natural continuous speech uttered by 1 male speaker. Nearly all scores on binary phonetic features range between 90 % and 99 %.

Most conventional speech recognition neural networks have a serious drawback: the network output values do not correspond to candidate likelihoods. The PFN is a multi-layer neural network with fewer hidden units than input units prepared for each of the phoneme categories. Each network is trained as identity mapping by speech data belonging to one phoneme category. In the recognition process, the similarity between the input data and output data is computed for each network. The results of the experiment to apply the Japanese vowel recognition task showed that the PFN recognition rates for the top 2 or more choices are higher than those of a conventional 3-layer neural network. It was also confirmed that the PFN outputs represented candidate likelihoods.\n",

    "Two methods to transcribe spoken utterances into phonemes are described and compared. Both operate on symbolic input provided by using Kohonen's Self-Organizing Feature Maps to vector quantize speech frames into code sequences. The idea is to transform the code sequences deteriorated by coarticulation effects and by an unideal acoustic processor closer to ideal sequences. This facilitates almost trivial conversion into phonemes accomplished without any statistical models. One method called Dynamically Focusing Context (DFC) is based on context-sensitive transformation rules, and the other on a feed-forward network trained using error back-propagation. The network uses multiresolution input derived from the code sequence. The performance of these methods is almost equal: the DFC reduces the error rate about 30 per cents, and the latter method about 25 per cents. The training time required by the feed-forward network is, however, orders of magnitude longer.\n",

    "In this paper, a phoneme recognition method using Pairwise Discriminant Time-Delay Neural Networks (PD-TDNNs) is proposed. In conventional approaches to phoneme recognition based on neural networks, it was found that the difference between training data and testing data degrades recognition performance. To overcome this problem, we developed a phoneme recognition method using PD-TDNNs. Each PD-TDNN has the ability to discriminate between two phoneme categories. In this method, phoneme candidates are selected by judging multiple pair discrimination scores, each of which is obtained from the PD-TDNN. We tested this method on a phoneme recognition task for /b,d,g,m,n,N/. Testing on continuous speech using the PD-TDNNs which were trained with the phoneme data in isolated word utterances, we obtained a first candidate recognition rate of 81.6%, and 96.7% for the cumulative recognition rate up to third candidates.\n",

We propose the Subspace Training (SST) algorithm with the SM and the Decision Controlled Back Propagation Training (DCBPT) algorithm to reduce training times.

    "This paper proposes a new phoneme-based speech recognition approach using neural networks trained to recognize sub-phonemes. The sub-phoneme is an acoustic unit which is shorter than a phoneme. The sub-phoneme recognition neural networks exhibit a more precise firing pattern and smaller firing gaps around phoneme boundaries than conventional phoneme recognition neural networks. The word or sentence score is given by the normalized highest sum of the output neuron firing score, which is obtained by the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. A Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) structure is employed for the sub-phoneme recognizer. The proposed method has been evaluated through word recognition using a continuous speech database. The results show that the recognition rate greatly improves when the sub-phoneme is introduced as a recognition unit. The best word recognition rate is obtained when a phoneme period is divided into front and rear sub-phonemes. The recognition rate is further improved by introducing a multiple entry word dictionary.\n",

    "In this paper we have developed a novel technique to deal with the problem of feeding a temporal variable speech signal to Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP), which generally only accept fixed-dimension input pattern, for speech recognition. Instead of using conventional linear or nonlinear interpolation methods, this method is based on the integration of an MLP with Finite-State Vector Quantizer (FSVQ) which is characterized by the ability to memorize the correlations between successive speech feature vectors. FSVQ is designed to map the variable length input pattern into an activation trace on a set of sub-codebooks, each of which corresponds to a 'frame' input unit of the MLP. Experiments show that for the multi-speaker English Alphabet E-set task it can achieve better performance than an MLP with a non linearly interpolated input of fixed dimension.\n",

The advantage to this approach is the ability to incorporate multiple sources of evidence (features, temporal context) without restrictive assumptions of distribution or statistical independence. In our earlier publications on this topic, a hybrid MLP/HMM continuous speech recognition algorithm was tested on the SPICOS German-language data base. In our recent work, we have shifted to the speaker-dependent portion of DARPA's English language Resource Management (RM) data base. Both consist of continuous utterances (sentences) and incorporate a lexicon of roughly 1000 words. Preliminary results appear to support the previously reported utility of MLP probability estimation for continuous speech recognition (at least, for the case of this simple form of HMM).\n",

We examined six recognizers: a discrete HMM, a continuous HMM, TDNN, Shift-tolerant LVQ2, an LVQ-HMMhybrid algorithm, and a Fuzzy LVQ-HMM hybrid algorithm. The experiment results mainly show the following two points: 1) the recognizers with great discriminative power on the isolated-mode testing data do not necessarily perform highly on the continuous-mode testing data, and 2) algorithms such as Shift-tolerant LVQ2 and Fuzzy LVQ-HMM (which integrates Fuzzy VQ into LVQ-HMM) may be able to achieve robust as well as accurate recognition- i.e. perform well on both continuous and isolated mode data.\n",

    "This paper proposes mappings of supervisory signals in layered neural networks for lip-reading the five Japanese vowels with the aim of enhancing recognition. The feature parameters of the width P\\ and height Pi of the lip shape and the distance P3 between the top of the upper lip and the bottom of the jaw are selected. Mappings from the input vector with the three feature parameters to the desired output vectors with various supervisory signals are discussed on the basis of the similarity between the pentagonal distribution of the F1-F2 formant diagram and the P1-P2(P1-P3) diagram. As a result of speaker-dependent lip reading experiments using twenty test sets of five vowels, the recognition rates of the mappings of supervisory signals based on the spatial relationship between vowels are several percent higher than the rates of the mappings disregarding the relationship. Finally, a mapping for generating the desired relationship between vowels in the hidden layer is proposed, and the effectiveness of the mapping is demonstrated.\n",

    "A new method of representing structured data in neural network classifiers, known as the Compositional Representation has been proposed [4, 5]. This paper gives a brief description of the method, (in particular where it differs from [4]) and applies it to a word recognition task of a isolated multi-speaker data base. The Compositional Representation represents structured data such as strings or lattices of arbitrary length in an n2 dimensional domain (n being a fixed parameter of the model), thus making it possible to use as input for a neural network with n2 input units. The representation can be trained using standard back-propagation. A training algorithm that allocates separate learning factors for each weight is proposed. It has been found that this method converges several orders of magnitude faster than the usual method with just one learning parameter plus momentum term.\n",

    "This paper describes the recognition and synthesis strategies employed in the design and development of a voice input-output system using isolated words. The criterion for the design of the system have been low cost and its suitability for applications in the areas such as control of elctronic/mechanical systems and aids for handicapped by voice commands particularly using isolated words (Abdul Mobin et. al [1][2][3][4][5] [6]). The system consists of a speech recognition and a synthesis unit which can be used either separately or in combination. The hardware and software of the system are based on a Z-.80A microprocessor. The. recognition unit accepts isolated words spoken by a person through a close talking microphone. The detected signal is passed through a specially designed signal conditioning circuitry to obtain a constant signal level. The speech waveform is then processed to obtain a shortterm Fourier spectrum in real time using a audio spectrum analyzer chip ASA-16. The signal obtained from the analyzer is sampled and digitized at the. rate of 200 frames per second. The data is checked for background noise, impulse sounds, amplitude levels, minimum and maximum word lengths etc. Special software has been developed for amplitude normalisation, word boundary detection, time normalisation, data compression and pattern matching etc. [1], [2] and [4]. The speech synthesis unit has been designed using a commercially available phoneme based speech synthesizer chip SC-02 which is also controlled by the same Z-80A microprocessor. Programmes have been developed to synthesize Hindi and English words by generating a proper sequence of phonemes and controlling parameters such as speech rate, pitch, pitch movement rate, amplitude, articulation rate, vocal tract filter response, phoneme duration etc.\n",

It takes into consideration the concrete reality of communication, with all its components, included in contexts and viewed in their dynamicity. 3. The DC model used as a basis for the MLL is centered on concepts such as: a strong drive for communication, motivating the child to learn language; very early and predominant influence of the social environment; occurrence of language learning in a gradual and long process of development, etc. Though different in some basic respects, first and second language learning have also many common features. 4. Various facts will be offered as examples that validate this model.\n",

The system is based on hidden Markov modeling of phoneme-sized acoustic units using continuous mixture Gaussian densities. The mixture densities are generated using an algorithm which minimizes the average trace of the mixture components and makes use of the segmental structure of the speech signals. Methods of preparing a dictionary for decoding and controlling the perplexity of grammars are also elaborated. On a subset of TIMIT data-base with 443 words and a grammar perplexity of 49, the system achieved decoding rates of 87.4% sentence correct, 97.9% word correct and 97.5% word accuracy on the training set; on the test set, the rates are 72.4% sentence correct, 93.9% word correct and 92.4% word accuracy.\n",

    "This paper discusses the use of tree-based phone modeling to describe acoustic variations of speech, and its application to speech recognition system. There are many sources of variabilities that affect the realization of a phoneme: phonetic contexts, speakers, stress, speaking rates and so on. Explicit modeling with these sources of variabilities will give more accurate and more detailed phone models, but needs a large amount of speech data for training. Tree-based phone modeling is studied to solve this problem with three case studies: phone models with large VQ codebook sizes, decision tree clustering, and speaker-clustering. They are tested on speaker-independent continuous speech recognition experiments with a 991 word vocabulary. Tree-based phone modeling is shown to produce improvement in all three cases and to provide a good guide to provide trainability and generalizability.\n",

    "In this paper a new, tree-trellis based fast search for finding the N best sentence hypotheses in continuous speech recognition is proposed. The search consists of a forward, time-synchronous, trellis search and a backward, time asynchronous, tree search. The well known Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the best hypothesis in a trellis and for recording the scores of all partial paths time synchronously. A backward A* algorithm based tree search is used to grow partial paths time asynchronously. Each partial path in the backward tree search is rank ordered in a stack by the corresponding full path score, which is computed by adding the partial path score with the best possible score of the remaining path obtained from the trellis path map. In each path growing cycle, the current best partial path, which is at the top of the stack, is extended by one arc (word). The new tree-trellis search is different from the traditional time synchronous Viterbi search in its ability for finding not just the best but the N best paths of different word content. The new search is also different from the A* algorithm, or the stack algorithm, in its capability for providing an exact, full path score estimate of any given partial (i.e., incomplete) path before its completion. When compared with the best candidate Viterbi search, the search complexities for finding the N best strings are rather low, i.e., only a fraction more computation is needed.\n",

The structure for representing the vocabulary and the syntax are very complex to be directly created by a user, so an easy, interactive way has been implemented for modeling command language of applications, and an automatic, transparent procedure gets the task of creating structures required by training and recognition algorithms. In the latter phase, the two major problems the system has to solve are the elimination of recursive structures (very frequent specially in office automation applications), and the need to break some sequences of words in order to cope with keyboard- speech mixed inputs in applications which cannot be completely interfaced by voice. For completeness, a description of how recognition uses the syntax has been provided.\n",

Even though HMM methods have considerable ability to recognize speech, it is still difficult to recognize individual phones in continuous speech without lexical information. This paper reports on a phonetic typewriter to improve HMM phone recognition performance by incorporating syllable trigrams. HMM phone units are trained using an isolated word database, and their duration parameters are modified in relation to the speaking rate. The syllable trigram tables are made from a large text database of over 35,000 syllables. Phone sequence probabilities calculated from the trigrams are combined with HMM probabilities. Limiting the number of intermediate candidates using these probabilities leads to an accurate phonetic typewriter system without excessive computation time.\n",

    "This paper describes an overview of our speech understanding system and reports on the recent results of the sentence recognition experiments. The system recognizes database queries in natural Japanese language spoken sentence by sentence. Based on a hierarchical architecture, the system predicts words strings in a top-down manner, however, the verifications proceeds irrelevantly to the word boundaries. Those phoneme strings bounded by the easily detectable phonemed are dynamically extracted from the predicted word string as verification templates. We carried out sentence recognition experiments using two different matching modules - the lattice matcher and the HMM matcher. The controller adopted a left-to-right time-synchronous beam-search strategy for searching likely sentences. The speech corpus consists of 159 sentences read by three Japanese male speakers. The task perplexity was 8.3. Using the speaker-dependent HMM parameters, the sentence recognition rates were 62.3~71.1 % for the lattice matcher and 83.0-92.5 % for the HMM matcher.\n",

    "Reported here are developmental relations between language and thought in the one-word period. However, these relations are different from those discussed in classic developmental theories like Piaget's. Piaget proposed that deferred imitation emerged at about 18 months, in synchrony with other aspects of the \"semiotic function\" including spoken language. Our findings establish deferred imitation in 9-month-olds. Thus, the emergence of deferred imitation is not a cognitive correlate of language; it is exhibited before language is acquired. We develop the \"specificity hypothesis\" concerning the interrelation between certain aspects of early semantic and cognitive development. Data are adduced showing highly specific relations between: (a) categorization and the onset of the \"naming explosion,\" (b) object permanence and the use of words encoding disappearance, and (c) means-ends understanding and words encoding success and failure.\n",

    "Among topics related to the acquisition of language, the acquisition of speech is particularly fascinating. Speech units - the consonants and vowels that make up words - are comprised of features. The perception of these features has been studied in very young infants, and this has provided a window on the acquisition of language from its very beginning. Infants display highly sophisticated speech perception skills, leading theorists to emphasize innate mechanisms in infant speech perception. Linguistic experience eventually plays a role, however, because adults from different language environments perceive the same speech sounds very differently. At what age does linguistic experience affect phonetic perception? The new cross-language studies reported here show that exposure to a specific language alters infants' perception of speech by 6 months of age. The fact that phonetic perception is affected by early linguistic input suggests a new model of the development of speech perception.\n",

    "As a subset of a large scale study of American, French, Japanese, and Swedish infants' vocal productions, designed for tracing the emergence of language-specific features, we present some results on Japanese and French children. From the first words on, the consonant repertoires and some phonotactic characteristics of infants' vocalizations reflect ambient language specificities, as appearing in sets of \"target\" words, familiar to infants in each language group. We also examine some prosodic aspects of the disyllables produced by 3 Japanese and 4 French children at the 25-word stage, a little before the phonological stage. F0 contour and syllabic durations in disyllables (words or babbling), are also clearly language- specific. For French infants, rising F0 contours and final syllable lengthening are the rule, whereas the opposite patterns are found for Japanese children.\n",

    "This study investigated how native speakers of Japanese, who are midway toward acquiring English phonemes, perceive and produce American English /r/, /I/, and /w/ sounds. From the perceptual experiments using synthesized stimuli, the following results are obtained. Japanese listeners perceive /r/ and /I/ sounds non-categorically, and they use both F2 and F3 frequencies as cues to identify /r/ and /I/. In contrast, American listeners perceive these sounds categorically using F3 as the primary cue. This result is consistent with the result obtained from the acoustic analysis of the /r/ and /I/ sounds produced by native Japanese. F3 frequency is a main feature for American subjects to produce /r/ differently from /I/. Such acoustic features, i.e. formant frequencies of the consonant part, are not well differentiated into phoneme categories when Japanese speakers produce these phonemes. However, the tendency to use both F2 and F3 frequencies, even as production cues, is observed in the sounds by Japanese speakers.\n",

    "This study examines the perception of inter-stress-intervals by the Americans and the Japanese learners of English. Perception experiments were performed by using LPC analysis and synthesis of speech in which the durations of target stressed vowels were lengthened or shortened. We measured the discrimination of the stressed vowel durations as well as the influence of the durational change in a stressed vowel on the perception of the naturalness of temporal patterns. The results of the experiments demonstrated that non-proficient Japanese speakers of English are not less sensitive than the Americans in discriminating the durations of stressed vowels. However, their judgments of what is natural for a stressed vowel span a broader range of vowel durations than for the Americans. Moreover, a durational adjustment in the following unstressed syllable compensated for the lengthening of the stressed vowel in the case of the American listeners, but not in the case of the Japanese listeners. These results indicate that the ISI is a temporal unit in the perception of English for the Americans, but not for the non-proficient Japanese speakers, thus lending support for the traditional distinction between English versus Japanese as being stress-timed versus mora-timed.\n",

This system analyzes an arbitrary text morphologically with a dictionary which has 100,000 entry words, their grammatical attributes, and their phonetic and accent information. This analysis separates the text into individual terms, and the phonetic and accent data for the individual terms are obtained from the dictionary. In the proposed system, rules play an important role in improving the speech in order to produce a high quality speech. These rules decide whether the phonetic symbols for each term are separated or unified, and whether a part of them are modified or not : to modify a vowel sound to a long sound, to make a breath sound, and to make a nasal sound, whether the accent position of each term is shifted or not, and how long the duration between individual terms is. The authors tried out this system in the field of electronic mail. If the mail receiver wishes to confirm a mail text when out of his or her office, the person can call the mail box by telephone and obtain a synthesized speech of the mail produced by the system.\n",

    "A prototype for a speech-to-text transcription system is described. This system recognizes continuous phrasal speech and transcribes it in Japanese text. This paper outlines methods for acoustic and linguistic processing, and describes the system configuration and results of performance evaluation tests. As a text is spoken phrase by phrase, it is recognized by a word-spotting method using a continuous dynamic programming technique. High frequency words and CVs in continuous phrasal speech are detected using established CV and word templates. The CV and word candidates are converted to phrase candidates using a word dictionary, inflection table, post positional word dictionary, compound word table, and phrase syntactic pattern table. Frequent phrase co-occurrence patterns are used to select feasible phrase candidates. A performance evaluation test is carried out for Japanese X-ray CT scanning reports. Conversion accuracies of 80% and 65% are obtained for normal and abnormal medical findings, at input speeds of 100 Chinese characters/minute and 50 Chinese characters/minute respectively. These input speeds equal those of a professional transcriber and a novice transcriber after 20 days of training.\n",

A new definition of signal-to-noise ratio is proposed to cope with the low-pass type auto noise and frequency characteristics of human hearing, and to evaluate speech power level properly. Noise robustness is realized by the improvement of end-point detection and sharpening of spectral peaks. To minimize memory size and computational load, cepstrum coefficients of the matching template are quantized with the steps designed according to the inverse of cepstrum weighting function. Recognition and ADPCM recording-synthesis are executed in parallel in one DSP. Road tests revealed that the recognition rate for 20 words vocabulary exceeds 95% with 2 successive utterances and 40cm of microphone distance.\n",

ATR has already implemented a predictive LR parsing algorithm in an HMM-based speech recognition system for Japanese. However, up to now, this system has used only intra-phrase grammatical constraints. In Japanese, a sentence is composed of several phrases, thus two kinds of grammars, namely an intra-phrase grammar and an inter-phrase grammar, are sufficient for recognizing sentences. Two-level predictive LR parsing makes it possible to use not only intra-phrase grammatical constraints but also inter-phrase grammatical constraints during speech recognition. The system is applied to Japanese sentence recognition, and attains a word accuracy of 95.9% and a sentence accuracy of 84.7%.\n",

A system has been developed to carry out recognition and understanding processes in parallel. We present a method which allows the system to dynamically compute weights, taking semantic knowledge into account during the recognition process, which is based on a dynamic time warping (IjTW) algorithm. The weights change during the course of an utterance recognition process, according to the interpretation of partial recognized sentences. Nested into the DTW algorithm, a natural language processor (NLP) computes semantic weights. It builds an interpretation using the joining operation of the conceptual graph model. The syntax describes the joining rules of conceptual graphs. Then, we show how a set of joining rules can be represented by a conceptual grammar from which a parser can be generated. The parsing process evaluates an interpretation of a partially recognized sentence according to a criterion using the overlapping rate of all the conceptual graphs which participate into the interpretation, in order to return a semantic weight.\n",

If unbalanced linguistic text samples are selected, the information extracted would not be suitable for a linguistic model. To solve this problem, we need to quantitatively analyze linguistic texts. In this paper, we introduce a method to quantitatively analyze linguistic texts, and propose a method for selecting linguistic texts. Moreover, we describe the possibility of developing a criterion for selecting test texts needed for system evaluation, and show the relationship between recognition system performance and the features of the sample text group used for the linguistic model.\n",

    "This paper describes a sentence speech recognition system based on phoneme-based hidden Markov models (HMMs) and two grammatical constraints: a syntactic grammar of phrase structure and a semantic dependency grammar of sentence structure. A joint score, combining acoustic likelihood and linguistic certainty factors derived from phoneme based HMMs and two grammatical constraints, is maximized to obtain the optimal sentence recognition. A semantic analysis algorithm globally optimizes the joint score. This algorithm is based on two key techniques: most likely multi-phrase candidate-detection using the Viterbi algorithm, and breadth-first search for dependency parsing. Where the perplexity of the phrase syntax is 40, this system increases phrase recognition performance in the sentences by approximately 14%, showing the effectiveness of semantic dependency analysis.\n",

    "Traditionally phonologists have appealed to three independent phonetic features in separating English /bdg/ and /ptk/: V(oice), A(spiration), and F(orce of articulation). Moreover, these features were unequal,- one \"distinctive,\" the others \"predictable\" and/or \"redundant.\" Once F was distinctive; more recently V has been assigned this role. Moreover, where a distinctive feature once was the principal category marker, now it is not clear that a \"distinctive\" feature has special perceptual status. Experimental evidence suggests that no single property can be isolated as the perceptually distinctive one, nor does any seem so devoid of \"cue potential\" that it maintains its neutrality under all the conditions that experimental ingenuity and modern technical facilities can contrive.\n",

    "In this paper we describe a lexical study of phoneme collocational constraints using a metric motivated by information theory. We used a pairwise, hierarchical clustering technique to combine phonemes into classes using a normalized measure of mutual information. The result of this clustering process can be displayed as a dendrogram, from which one may select an arbitrary number of equivalence classes. We have conducted a number of experiments investigating phoneme collocational constraints within pairs and triplets. In many cases we found that phonemes are organized into classes that share certain phonological features. In fact, phonemes that have similar acoustic properties often exhibit similar collocational constraints. We also compared the constraining power of our phoneme classes with those chosen by a phonological criterion, and found ours to be more than competitive. Based on our results, we conclude that our information theoretic metric is particularly useful as a description of lexical constraining power.\n",

    "This study sought experimental support for the following two proposed collocational constraints for English: (1) that syllable peaks consist of a vowel plus optional sonorant and (2) that the second consonant of a coda must be a coronal. In our experiment, subjects were trained to identify vowel or coda substitutions in words containing only post-vocalic obstruents, then were tested on their ability to identify the same substitutions in words where the first post-vocalic element was a nasal or /I/, which was sometimes treated as part of the nucleus (tense vs. lax vowel) and sometimes as part of the coda (coronal vs. other consonant or cluster). The following significant differences emerged, but only on the two coda tasks: (1) nasals were, in general, more coda-like ('C-sticky') than /I/, (2) nasals and /I/ together were more coda-like after tense vowels than after lax vowels, and (3) they were also more coda-like before single coronal consonants than elsewhere, as expected from the theory.\n",

    "Results are presented from a multi-speaker, multi-lingual method of phonetic label alignment which is based on a combined application of a Self-Organising Neural Network and a Viterbi decoding and level-building technique constrained by an independently specified string of phonetic segments. The Neural Network is trained to convert vectors of cepstral coefficients into vectors of continuously valued acoustic-phonetic features, and to derive a multi-dimensional Gaussian probability density function for each phonemic unit. Multi-lingual application simply requires the definition of the features for each new language. The Viterbi decoding and Level-Building technique is applied to the task of performing label alignment on large speech corpora. The paper firstly presents results for Danish and English, with distributions for selected features and phonemes in the two languages to show the validity of the approach. Covariance analysis within a language allows a reduction of the features to a maximally discriminative set, and comparison across the languages points to the multi- lingual validity of the feature definitions. Secondly, results are given in a number of histograms showing the accuracy of the alignment settings for selected phoneme classes compared to corresponding settings from manually labelled test databases. The work has been developed in part under the ESPRIT project 'Speech Assessment Methodology' (SAM).\n",

    "Coarticulation in continuous speech causes vowel formant tracks to be affected by nearby phonemes. Generally continuous speech causes the vowel formant targets to be centralised relative to their isolated word counterparts. The present study uses data from one male talker in the CSTR/ATR speech database saying 200 phonetically rich sentences. By concentrating on one talker, coarticulation can be studied without the confounding effects of accents, speech habits and formant ranges from many talkers. While some of these effects could be normalised out of multitalker data, some residual variance remains with all the methods we have tried. The 21 vowels of RP British English have been studied, the 14 monothongal vowels, /ii, i, a, e, aa, uh, oo, o, u, u\", @@, @, 1/ and the 7 diphthongal vowels /ai, au, e@, ei, i@, oi, ou, u@/. Formant tracks were computed automatically and scanned for errors by hand. The formant frequency values at the right and left edges and the temporal center of the hand labelled vowel region are obtained. These values are plotted on scatter plots and analyzed using statistical methods. Generally the vowels are most effected by nearby semi-vowels /l, r, y, w/. No simple relationship between adjacent phoneme place of articulation and the vowel target change has been found. The data shows the presence of \"robust vowels\" which are not greatly effected by nearby semi-vowels. These vowels are not simply stressed vowels, but depend on duration and others factors being studied. Similar results were found in American English.\n",

The results of the segmentation and of the recognition for three male speakers are given commented.\n",

Various combinations of three prosodic features, in an English sentence uttered by a Japanese speaker in a typically Japanese fashion, were replaced with the same combinations of the prosodic features of the same English sentence read by an Englishman.

Lombard speech and deliberately loud speech shared more similarities than differences and appear to result from the same speech production mechanisms. Both were produced with more effort so that energy and fundamental frequency increased. Both were produced with a wider mouth opening so that formants, particularly Fl, shifted.

    "Speech localization is simulated using the head-related transfer functions (HRTF) in order to clarify the binaural effects on speech intelligibility under the condition of noise disturbance. The HRTF filter coefficients are specifically calculated for the subject's own head and ears. The frequency response of the headphone is compensated for using an inverse filter calculated from the response at the subject's own ear canal entrance point. The phoneme articulation score under disturbance of noise is improved when the simulated distance in localization between the phoneme and noise is increased even though the total signal to noise ratio is maintained constant. This result shows the binaural effect in speech intelligibility under the noise disturbance, which is regarded as a part of the well-known cocktail party effect.\n",

Our preliminary data for two commercial synthesisers underline both issues: the two synthesisers were ranked in one order on a segmental intelligibility test, but in the opposite order on a more application-like comprehension test. For the latter test, listeners' accuracy may be related to their performance speed. Results are related to the underlying issues, and two approaches to measurement of cognitive load are suggested.\n",

    "A design of spoken Chinese corpus is proposed which consists of five sub-corpora Cl to C5. The design principles are (1) Mono-syllables are important not only for the recognition of isolated syllables but also for the recognition of connected spoken Chinese because they simplify the isolation of phonetic information in the training phase, (2) A corpus including all inter-syllable triphones captures all the immediate left- and right-context of phones at syllabic boundaries. This is a logical and practical compromise between exhausting all possible syllabic transitions and keeping the corpus building effort at a manageable level. Cl consists of 433 mono-syllables and 4 consonant clusters in each of its four versions. Each toned syllable exists in at least one of the four versions and the 433 mono-syllables in each version include all the syllables in one of the four regular tones (yin, yang, shang and qu) plus all the neutral-toned ones. C2 is a collection of 16 digit strings each ranging from 4 to 7 digits in length. These strings exhaust all the inter-digits triphones. C3 has 30 geographic names each of two to five syllables. C4 consists of 859 short phrases each of six to nine syllables long forming the bulk of the inter-syllable triphone collection. C5 is a catch-all sub-corpus composed of all the inter-syllable triphones which do not appear in C2 to C4. These triphones are very seldomly used in the Chinese language today and can be ignored in recognizer training for practical purposes. Keywords:-Speech database, isolated speech, connected speech, Putonghua, inter-syllable triphones, coarticulatiori between syllables\n",

    "In this paper we present a system designed for the broad labelling of a large speech acoustic database. This system uses an original labelling strategy which is based on 3 characteristics: a time-expanded (10 times) speech sound output, an automatic scanning of the corresponding label strings and a speech visualization (using a moving cursor which is synchronized with the time-expanded speech sound output and the label strings scanning). By using an algorithm that is similar to the SOLA algorithm proposed by Roucos [1], the time-expansion technique produces a good quality 10 times expanded speech signal from the speech signal to be labelled. The time-expanded speech listening brings out a fine speech structure. This result is usually attained, with difficulty, by careful spectrogram reading in a classic manual labelling system (signal editors).The advantage of the automatic label strings scanning mechanism is that it enables the cursor to be moved by the system instead of by the operator. Eventually the operator labelling task is only confirmation of the current label. Moreover the time-expanded mechanism can be viewed as a kind of \" acoustic magnifying glass \" which brings some additional perceptual information on the signal.\n",

    "Speech labeling is an indispensable task for construction of speech data bases. Currently, speech labeling is done manually by experts. Thus it takes too much time and labor to label large amount of speech data. In order to decrease such labor, it is necessary to construct an automatic labeling system. The authors have been developing a speech labeling system based on a generate-and-test architecture with segmentation knowledge. Performance evaluation shows that for closed data, 99.1% segments are identified within 30ms of the locations determined by a human expert and 95.5% segments are also identified correctly for open data with rejection rates of 6.7% and 8.9%, respectively. This paper describes the system organization and the results of performance evaluation.\n",

    "Automatic speech recognition systems are typically trained on speech data collected in the laboratory and then tested on a mutually exclusive subset of the same data. Results of these tests may significantly overestimate performance in the field. It could be that systems should be trained and/or tested on spontaneously-produced real user field data. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of a speaker independent isolated word telephone network speech recognition system when tested on laboratory vs. real user data under two training scenarios: 1. trained on laboratory and 2. trained on real user data. The results of this experiment suggest that real user speech databases are needed to achieve high accuracy speech recognition results in the field. In addition, it appears that a system trained on user data can be accurately tested with either real user or laboratory speech databases.\n",

    "This paper proposes a multilingual set of speech samples collected to standardize an artificial voice as a data base in order to evaluate the language and talker dependency of a digital coding algorithm. Speech recordings are made by telecommunication laboratories of telecommunication administration or operating companies participating in the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) under uniform conditions. The number of languages is 20. Each language is , composed of at least 16 short sentences and the duration of each sentence is about 8 seconds. To investigate the impartiality of the data base, the fundamental statistical speech characteristics of the speech samples are analyzed. It is confirmed that the results agree with those of previous researches taking into account the dispersions. The speech quality dependency on talker and language is investigated when this set of speech samples is coded and applied to three typical digital coding algorithms. This set of speech samples reduces the bias in the evaluation due to the limited speech samples. Speech samples are stored on CD-ROM and are publicly available.\n",

Here we derive the time-optimal gain sequence and demonstrate its efficacy for a number of cases. It is demonstrated that the new method is time optimal and that its performance tends to that of VQ with the LBG algorithm. Finally the CVQ for linear predictive data with respect to the Itakura distance measure is applied to a multipulse linear predictive speech coder using data from the TIMIT database.

    "This paper makes a comparison of several preprocessors for the task of speaker independent phoneme recognition from the TIMIT database using a recurrent error propagation network recogniser [l] The paper evaluates FFT, filterbank, auditory model and LPC based techniques in the spectral and cepstral domains and adds some simple features such as estimates of the degree of voicing, formant positions and amplitudes. The paper concludes that the features do not make a significant contribution and that the spectral domain representations, independent of their derivation, are better suited to this task. However, we find that the recogniser was relatively insensitive to preprocessor and changes in the architecture and training of the recogniser are more significant. The current, recognition rate on the TIMIT database of 61 symbols is 69.5% correct (64.0% including insertion errors) and on a reduced 39 symbol set the recognition rate is 76.1% correct (70.4%). This compares favourably with the results of other methods, such as Hidden Markov Models, on the same task.\n",

    "A neural network architecture was designed for locating word boundaries and identifying words from phoneme sequences. This architecture was tested in three sets of studies. First, a highly redundant corpus with a restricted vocabulary was generated and the network was trained with a limited number of phonemic variations for the words in the corpus. Tests of network performance on a transfer set (i.e., sentences not used during training) yielded a very low error rate. In a second study, a network was trained to identify words from expert transcriptions of speech. On a transfer test, error rate for correct simultaneous identification of words and word boundaries was 31%. The third study used the output of a phoneme classifier as the input to the word and word boundary identification network. The error rate on a transfer test set was 49% for this task. Overall, these studies provide a first step at identifying words in connected discourse with a neural network. While the results are moderately encouraging, the identification of word boundaries was especially difficult when the input sequences contained many inserted and deleted phonemes. Although many issues, including scaling the model to larger corpora, are unresolved, many strategies for improving performance remain to be explored.\n",

    "Many researchers achieved high phoneme recognition rates by multi-layered neural networks with Linear Discrimination Neural units (LDN). However, it is difficult to analyze the functions of those LDN networks. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered neural network with Elliptic Discrimination Neural units (EDN) in order to interpret the functions of each unit in the network more easily. The center of the elliptic discrimination boundary of a neural unit corresponds to the typical point in a input space. The radii of the ellipse correspond to the extent of the input space, hence it becomes clear which components of the input space are important to each unit in the EDN network. For comparison between EDN and LDN, we carried out the recognition experiments of phonemes /b,d,g/ in 5240 tokens of a Japanese speech database. The back-propagation learning procedure was used to train each network. In the experiments, we obtained recognition rates of EDN network as high as that of LDN network. We also confirmed which components of the input are important to each unit in the EDN network. Thus we found some significant regions for recognition on the input spectrogram. These regions are localized both by time and in frequency, thus the network is robust for time variations of input vectors.\n",

To strive towards a fair and meaningful comparison, the mel-frequency niters were carefully designed to resemble the filters of SAM and the dimensionality of the feature vectors were constrained to be equal. The representations were compared on the basis of classifying 16 vowels in American English. Experiments with speech degraded by adding white noise were also conducted. Our results are based on over 22,000 vowel tokens excised from 2,750 sentences spoken by 550 speakers. The combined Synchronous and Mean Rate responses from SAM outperformed all the other representations with both undegraded and noisy speech, yielding top-choice accuracies of 66% and 54% respectively.\n",

The input layer has context buffers to extract context sensitive features in the input. The analog target function in the output layer reflects the confidence level of the output for the current input in the context buffer. Speaker dependent recognition results for 10 syllables using cepstral coefficients show that the extended Elman's network is superior to the Elman's network as well as Multi-layer Perceptron. The recognition accuracy of the extended Elman's network is better than that of the cepstral distance measure and comparable to that of the weighted cepstral distance measure using dynamic time warping based template matching. Preliminary conclusion is that the input context buffers with time replicated scanning enhance the shift invariant capability of the recurrent neural network.\n",

Neural networks can automatically learn phoneme spotting and classification by this method if hand-labeled speech data are given. In this method, first, the candidate time positions of consonant in continuous speech were extracted using an acoustic cues which indicated the possibility of the consonant location. Then, the phoneme label corresponding to the running spectra around the candidate point was determined based on hand-labeled results for speech wave. These candidate points were divided into several groups depending on acoustic cues in order to reduce the charge of neural network learning. The neural networks were trained by the backpropagation learning procedure as those were able to label continuous speech similar to hand-labeled results when the running spectra around the consonant candidate points were given. The speaker independent consonant recognition experiment showed the recognition rate of about 80 % for the test data set. This result proved the effectiveness of this method.\n",

We have done recognition experiments with CVC words, differing in their initial consonant phonemes only, e.g. peep vs beep and found that most of the errors are due to the system not distinguishing between voiceless/voiced stop consonants. There are a number of acoustic cues useful to improve distinction between voiceless/voiced plosives, specifically, the fundamental frequency at voicing onset and the Voice Onset Time (VOT). This paper reports on recognition experiments where both of these features are extracted from the speech signal and are combined with the other features using the linear discriminant network. The results from the experiments confirmed that the addition of these two input features improved the performance of the recogniser for confusable word-pairs.\n",

    "This report first discusses storage media for speech databases and performance indexes for discrete and connected word recognition. Secondly, the report describes recent speech database projects in Japan in which the author has been involved. The JEIDA Japanese Common Speech Data Corpus was first reported on in 1986. It has been converted to DAT recently. The JEIDA Noise Database has been released to the public recently. It contains various kinds of environmental noise and standard noise for sound level calibration. The 'Spoken Language' project collected speech data including continuous speech spoken by 10 males and 10 females. The 'Spoken Japanese' project, started in 1989, attempts to collect various dialectal speech from all over Japan and create speech databases. A compact disc containing a fairy tale and weather forecast spoken by 20 dialect speakers has been produced.\n",

The first two are collected from 10 male speakers and the last, from 4 male and 4 female speakers. For the easy application of the database in speech research, we proposed a 2-level acoustic-phonetic transcription to express almost all possible phonetic environments in Korean. And the transcriptions were carried out manually. For the effective management of these databases, a relational database management system, which helps fast access and easy manipulation, was used.\n",

    "Abstract We are constructing\" a dialogue database called the ATR Dialogue Database (ADD) as the basic data to study an automatic interpreting telephony system. ADD is a large structured database of dialogues collected from simulated telephone or keyboard conversations which are spontaneously spoken or typed in Japanese or English. The corpus collected in one language is manually translated/interpreted to the other language and the correspondences of these two corpora are made by several linguistic units. We compared telephone dialogues and keyboard dialogues in ADD. From the examination of the experiment results, we can conclude that, except for the following items, linguistic phenomena in telephone dialogues are almost the same of those in keyboard dialogues. The phenomena peculiar to telephone dialogues are the existence of interjections, restatements, fragmental sentences, long complex sentences, redundant expressions and indirect expressions.\n",

    "BREF, a large read-speech corpus in French has been designed with several aims: to provide enough speech data to develop dictation machines, to provide data for evaluation of continuous speech recognition systems (both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent), and to provide a corpus of continuous speech to study phonological variations. This paper presents some of the design considerations of BREF, focusing on the text analysis and the selection of text materials. The texts to be read were selected from 5 million words of the French newspaper, Le Monde. In total, 11,000 texts were selected, with an emphasis on maximizing the number of distinct triphones. Separate text materials were selected for training and test corpora. The goal is to obtain about 10,000 words (approximately 60-70 min.) of speech from each of 100 speakers, from different French dialects.\n",

    "As part of our effort in developing the MIT voyager system, we recently collected speech data from 50 male and 50 female subjects under a simulation mode, in which spoken sentences were typed into the computer for automatic natural language processing and response generation. Since a computer log of the spoken dialogue was maintained, we were able to ask the subjects to provide read versions of the sentences as well. Thus the corpus includes both a read version arid a spontaneous version of (approximately) the same sentence, modulo false starts and filled pauses in the spontaneous version. These corpora enable us to make a direct comparison between spontaneous and read speech. All in all, we were able to collect nearly 5000 spontaneous sentences, with an equal number of read sentences. All sentences were digitized and orthographically transcribed. In addition, time-aligned phonetic transcriptions were obtained for about 35% of the data. This paper documents the data collection process, and provides some linguistic and acoustic analyses of the collected data.\n",

The first feature is a distributed speech database composed of various types of storages(optical disk, magnetic disk, CD-ROM) and communication networks(Ethernet, GP-IB). This database contains 12 GB speech waveform data. The second feature is a virtual database. An unified dictionary administrates allocation of the original speech waveform data and the secondary data on various kinds of storages. It is not necessary for users to know the allocation of the data. The third feature is the automatic acquisition system of speech information based on a given phoneme string for an input speech. The fourth feature is a user-friendly database editor. The database is built up based on relational tables. The database editor has functions of data insertion, data deletion, and data display. Furthermore, frequently used speech analysis methods, a speech synthesizer and a speech recognizer are implemented to the database. Using those functions it is very easy for an user to carry out speech research without any knowledge concerning to the database.\n",

    "In Automatic Speech Recognition it is rather straightforward that large and diverse spoken language databases are required to train and to test speech input systems. For unlimited-text-to-speech rule-synthesis systems this is less apparent. These systems speak with one or few voices only, cannot just imitate natural speech, apply rules that are a mixture of database 'facts', designer's intuitions, and compensations for system insufficiencies, whereas subjective evaluation requires different texts all the time. Still, carefully designed, relatively small, annotated, spoken language databases can be an indispensable source of information and can be of some value as a standard for comparison. Such databases should be appropriately 'documented' in terms of orthographic input, grammatical categories, prosodic labeling, detailed acoustic-phonetic labeling, and voice characteristics.\n",

    "Effects such as additive noise and noise-induced changes in vocal effort (Lombard effect) can cause significant loss of performance for recognizers trained on normal (non-noisy, non-Lombard) speech. In earlier work, improvements to recognition rate over a \"standard\" speech representation consisting of cepstral coefficients and their first time-derivative (calculated over a 50 msec interval) were demonstrated on the English digits vocabulary by lengthening the interval over which the first derivative is calculated and incorporating a second derivative feature. The current paper extends this work by considering recognition of a much more confusable vocabulary. The recognition results are analyzed for each proposed change in the speech representation, examined by confusable subsets of the vocabulary and contrasted with previous results. Most of the earlier findings for the digits vocabulary were confirmed for the confusable vocabulary. Additionally, it was found that adding a third derivative feature further enhances performance.\n",

    "This paper addresses the problem of automatic speech recognition under Lombard and noise conditions. The main contributions include the statistical analysis of vocal tract and speech parameters under Lombard effect, and the formulation of a new speech recognition system which employs adaptive noise suppression and Lombard effect compensation front-end processors. The effects on formant location, bandwidth, and mel-cepstral parameters from noise and Lombard effect are presented. These parameters vary greatly, with significant variations across all phonemes for spectral tilt. Approximately half of all mel-cepstral parameters result in statistically significant variation from neutral. The significance of parameter variation between noisefree and noisy Lombard conditions shifts, suggesting the need for an alternate compensation for noise-free and noisy Lombard speech. A new recognition algorithm employing noise adaptive boundary detection, noise suppression, and voiced/unvoiced Lombard compensation is presented. Observed shift in mean cepstral values from neutral can be modeled using an exponential tilt, as suggested by Chen [3], but that the exponential form appears to differ for each phoneme class. A new Lombard effect compensator is formulated which allows varying degrees of compensation to be placed on voiced/unvoiced speech sections. Preliminary recognition results suggest that separate compensation of voiced and unvoiced speech sections improves recognition performance by as much as 10% over no compensation.\n",

    "This paper describes a speaker-independent word recognition method in noisy environments using dynamic and averaged spectral features based on a two-dimensional mel-cepstrum (TDMC). A TDMC is defined as the two-dimensional Fourier transform of mel-frequency scaled logarithm spectra in the frequency and time domains, and it consists of averaged and dynamic features of the two-dimensional mel-log spectrum in the analyzed interval. This method uses distance measures based on averaged and dynamic spectral features of the TDMC of the analyzed word. Furthermore, one of noise-added reference pattern sets is used to improve this method. Speaker-independent word recognition experiments, in white noise and colored noise, for 10 Japanese digits uttered by ten male speakers show the effectiveness of this method. By using a reference pattern set of 20 dB this method gives the recognition error rate lower than 5% and 2% for white-noise-added speech and colored-noise-added speech of 20 and 10 dB SNR, respectively. This method gives better recognition rates than a standard one using a one-dimensional mel-cepstrum representing instantaneous spectral features.\n",

    "For speech recognition in mobile environments a number of severe problems have to be solved. This paper gives an overview of several approaches dealing with the basic problem of noise handling in speech recognition in relation to the characteristica of noise in the mobile environment. Using a qualitative description of the noise characteristica, it can be seen that most of the currently investigated noise-handling strategies are just capable of handling parts of the phenomena of \"mobile noise\". From the analysis of these algorithms a general architecture of a noise resistent speech recognition strategy for further investigation is derived.\n",

    "This paper describes an improved speaker-dependent isolated word recognition algorithm that overcomes the effect of variable noise environments. The noisy speech is received by dual inputs; primary and reference. Speech endpoints are detected by the power ratio of these two inputs. The noise power spectrum that overlaps the primary speech input is offset by the reference input noise spectrum where the spectrum is restricted to values lower than a mean noise spectrum. The Staggered Array DP algorithm is used for pattern matching and the inverse-variance weighted distance measure of LPC cepstrum and its' regression coefficients are applied as a spectral distance measure between the input pattern and the reference templates. These algorithms are applied to noisy speech uttered in an actual passenger car. Tests confirm the superiority of this approach over the conventional algorithms that use single speech input.\n",

    "This paper describes methods for improving the accuracy of our speaker independent speech recognition system in a noisy environment. Phoneme templates were selected from several varieties of phoneme templates, which were generated in typical noise environments, to simulate actual background noise. If none of these templates suits the noise environment, a template adaptation is performed by adding the estimated spectrum of the background noise to the mean vector of each phoneme template. A speech period detector and segmentation algorithm were also improved with respect to changes in environment noise. These approaches were applied to a hardware system and evaluated. Average phoneme recognition score is 71.6% by use of the template adaptation method. Input speech data was achieved by adding a noise to clean speech. Signal-to-noise ratio is 20dB. In a actual noisy environment(70-85dBA), an average word recognition score is 97%, using a twenty four word vocabulary.\n",

The background noise is assumed to be a sum of a stationary noise and isolated nonstationary noises, and it is also assumed that there are no overlapping between speech segments and nonstationary noises. The noise processing system described in this paper consists of three subsystems. The first subsystem is to detect nonstationary segments buried in the stationary noise. The second one is for the speech/nonspeech discrimination of the detected nonstationary segments. If they are identified as speech, the third subsystem begins to work for speech enhancement. This paper gives a detailed discussion on the third subsystem, which is based on the maximum likelihood estimation method. Experimental results show that the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio by the proposed method is more than 13dB.\n",

    "Electropalatography (EPG) is an instrumental technique which displays and records spatio-temporal details of tongue contacts with the hard palate during continuous speech. It has been useful in experimental phonetic research, particularly in identifying lingual co-articulatory effects in different languages, and in describing the precise articulatory characteristics of complex lingual fricative sounds such as /s/. In speech pathology also, the technique has had important clinical applications. For example, as a remedial tool, it can provide an immediate, real-time display of palatal contacts which can be used to modify abnormal articulatory gestures associated with certain types of speech disorders. A similar application yet to be fully explored is in pronunciation teaching. This paper describes a pilot experiment in which two Japanese learners of English are taught to produce an acceptable /r/,/l/ contrast with the aid of EPG.\n",

    "This paper proposes an English prosody training method using voice conversion technique. The unique point of this proposed method is that voice converted synthetic speech is used to train English prosody pronunciation. The synthetic speech is produced by converting important prosodic parameters in the student's speech into corresponding native English speaker's speech, while the student's voice characteristics except prosody are preserved. By using the proposed method, pronunciation problem can be easily found out, and training efficiency is improved. The comparative evaluations for training efficiency of the proposed training method and the conventional method show that the proposed method, using the voice converted synthetic speech, is more effective in English prosody training than the conventional method, using the native English speaker's original speech.\n",

The difficulties that Japanese speakers encounter when they learn English pronunciation involve the pronunciation of individual phonological segments, which is the segmental component, and word stress, sentence stress, and rhythm, which are considered as suprasegmental components. This paper is limited to the segmental component, especially to English consonants and syllable structure. The subject is examined, first, on the basis of a contrastive analysis of consonants of American English and Japanese, and second, on the basis of how the English segments are perceived and adapted by Japanese speakers according to properties of the system of Japanese phonology, in order to obtain admissible representations.\n",

    "It is generally believed that an adult has more difficulty mastering the pronunciation of a second language than does a child. Various studies, from psychological and methodological viewpoints, have found evidence that the child acquires the phonetics of speech much faster than does the adult. Various writers have discussed techniques and methods of teaching classroom. However, in Japan, very few researchers have attempted to verify scientifically whether or not the application of phonetic information in teaching English pronunciation will enhance adult performance. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the phonetic method, used with laser discs which show the articulation of English pronunciation, produces any significant differences from using the audio-lingual method only. The target English voiceless fricative I si sound is chosen. Althought the /s/ sound exists in the Japanese language, the English fricative /s/ requires a much stronger breath stream than the Japanese /s/. It is, therefore, one of the most difficult English sounds for Japanese to produce. Learning the correct way of breathing and articulation will facilitate the production of this significant /s/ sound. Subjects for the experimental group were from the junior class of International Budo University majoring in budo (martial ways). The control group are juniors from IBU majoring in physical education. Both groups are in the highest class of English proficiency of the four instructional levels. An identical measurement test is given before and after the training session. A sound analyzer, one of the devices of PROTS(Pronunciation Training System) is used. All spoken data from both Japanese groups are compared with those of native speakers of American English. The results will be observed.\n",

    "SRI is developing a system that uses real time speech recognition to diagnose, evaluate and provide training in spoken English. The paper first describes the methods and results of a study of the feasibility of automatically grading the performance of Japanese students when reading English aloud. Utterances recorded from Japanese speakers were independently rated by expert listeners. Speech grading software was developed from a speaker independent hidden-Markov-model speech recognition system. The automatic grading procedure first aligned the speech with a model and then compared the segments of the speech signal with models of those segments that have been developed from a database of speech from native speakers of English. The evaluation study showed that ratings of speech quality by experts are very reliable and automatic grades correlate well (r > 0.8) with those expert ratings. SRI is now extending this technology and integrating it in a spoken-language training system. This effort involves (1) porting SRI's DECIPHER speech recognition system to a microcomputer platform, and (2) extending the speech-evaluation software to more exactly diagnose a learner's pronunciation deficits and lead the learner through an appropriate regimen of exercises.\n",

    "This paper describes a continuous speech recognition system using phonemes as basic units in both of acoustic and linguistic processings. Acoustically the phoneme is difficult to be identified since it is strongly varied by the phonemic contexts. In order to cope with the contextual variability of the phonemes, we use a linear model called Linear Phonetic-Context Model(LPCM), which represents acoustical features as the sum of context-independent and context-dependent components. Incorporating with the LPCM we design a phoneme-based phrase recognition algorithm which accepts speech input of an arbitrary string of phonemes. The algorithm obtains plural recognition candidates using an end-point spotting method along with a beam-search technique. The language model bases on task-independent statistics of phoneme strings, and gives a probability of a phrase not existing in the corpus avoiding the null probability problem as in the simple N-gram model. In experiments to recognize 336 phrases extracted from 50 sentences spoken by a male speaker, we obtained a phoneme recognition rate of 95.0% and a phrase recognition rate of 67.9% without limiting a vocabulary.\n",

This information is essential to produce the PPP and is effective in English phoneme recognition. With this information the HMMs of all the phoneme types can compute their probability in parallel and in time synchronism.

The first level is phoneme level process which is carried out before linguistic process and provides the fundamental information of the linguistic process. The second level is word level process which is carried out after the linguistic process and provides the information of coarticulation of the consonant and the vowel in a word. For linguistic process, 12 kinds of Chinese sentence patterns most in use, have been registered in the form of the context-free grammars. Semantic analysis is carried out at the same time with the syntactic analysis. Experiments of phoneme, word and sentence recognition have been done to evaluate the performance of this system.\n",

    "This paper describes preliminary results for a new method of training multi-phone units for discrete hidden Markov model speech recognition systems. The context sensitive, potentially poorly trained multi-phone units are combined with smaller speech units by a weighting scheme favoring well-trained data. We tested this method for the Japanese language, using the multi-phone disyllable (VCV pattern in Japanese) unit and the tripartite disyllable unit. A tripartite disyllable is composed of smaller speech units, a single consonant phone (in the case of Japanese) surrounded by two vowel demiphones (context sensitive half phones). For speaker-dependent isolated-word recognition, and training on data from three recording sessions of the same continuous speech training set, we obtained an average recognition performance of 96.6% for the merged system. This is a 9.1% improvement in the recognition rate over the standard disyllable system, and 0.8% over the tripartite disyllable system.\n",

    "This paper describes performance evaluation in speech recognition system which uses transition probability between linguistic units. The lower limit of word recognition score is predicted based on phoneme recognition score and number of word pairs with short distance in a vocabulary defined by linguistic information. But it is difficult to calculate it when transition probability is used as linguistic information. We propose new algorithm to calculate it when bigram or trigram of linguistic units is used. Using this algorithm, we carry out performance prediction in speech recognition which uses bigram or trigram. Recognition score for word with 5 phonemes is more than 26% using bigram, more than 71% using trigram and more than 95% using a dictionary when phoneme recognition score is 90%, where bigram and trigram of phonemes are estimated from the 5,317 Japanese popular words. Recognition score of sentence composed of 11 words is more than 4.3% using bigram, on the other hand, more than 67% using trigram, when word recognition score is 80%, where bigram and trigram are estimated from 136 sentences represented with 18 kinds of speech.\n",

    "In this paper, we describe the sentence recognition method using word cooccurrence probability, and compare it with the method using CFG(Context-Free Grammar). Since the aim of this study is to investigate whether the word cooccurrence probability (bigram or trigram) is able to represent the corresponding context-free grammar or not, we calculated it from CFG, By comparing the results using the bigram method with those using the method of CFG, we realized that it is insufficiency to represent CFG with only word cooccurrence probabilities from both perplexity and sentence recognition accuracy. Therefore, to improve the bigram we have extended the bigram model to a quasi-trigram model (subclass-word-word). From the experimental results using this quasi-trigram we realized that the quasi-trigram model can represent the corresponding CFG better than the corresponding bigram model.\n",

    "This paper describes a Chinese spoken language understanding system USTC-2. Various kinds of knowledge such as acoustic-phonetics, vocabulary, syntax and semantics are represented and utilized in the system. It's constructed as an expert system based on frame representation capable of metting the needs of various tasks. In USTC-2 system, segmentation of input speech is carried out utilizing the energy contour, LPC variance and syllable length. Recognition is performed by a matching algorithm which constrains the search on the basis of morphological knowledge concerning both the part of word-class and and constituent syllales of a given word . The use of morpohological knowledge not only reduces the amount of computation but also increases the correct rate of syllable recognition in spoken Chinese sentences. An analysis method starting from KEYWORDS was proposed in speech understanding. This method combines syntastic analysis and semantic analysis together and has strong ability of correcting errors. The system discriminates homonymous syllables and homonymous words in each processing step.\n",

    "Natural conversational speech is so ambiguous that a system for understanding it requires the cooperation of many knowledge sources. We propose here a general framework for cooperative problem solving based on the blackboard model and a TMS (truth maintenance system) with an enhanced proving function. In this framework, a reasonably consistent interpretation is automatically kept on the blackboard, while each knowledge source performs its own inference and puts the results on the blackboard. Based on the proposed cooperative problem solving framework, we established a model for a system which can understand conversational speech through the cooperation of independent knowledge sources. The feasibility and validity of our basic framework were comfirmed by computer simulation experiments with several conversational speeches.\n",

    "This paper presents an efficient parsing algorithm for integrating the search problems both in speech and language processing in general use for speech understanding systems. The parsing algorithm we propose is regarded as an extension of the finite-state-network-directed, one-pass search algorithm to the one directed by a context-free grammar with retention of the time-synchronous procedure. Our attempt is to embed an active chart parser in the one-pass search algorithm for top-down prediction. Extended formalization of the chart parser makes it possible to incrementally generate both new vertices and multiple lexical edges based on a data-driven beam search technique. Moreover, some extensions of the algorithm are discussed. This paper shows that the one-pass search algorithm proposed can be extended to a time-synchronous Viterbi-style beam search procedure that is guaranteed to find the N most likely sentences under the constraints of a unification-based phrase structure grammar.\n",

In this perspective the main problem is the uncertainty processing. We consider the chart a suitable blackboard to represent and to work on the unperfectly recognized linguistic data and structures. Our approach to the uncertainty processing is based on the asynchronous interaction between several modules in which we implement the basic functionalities of the word hypothesization and of the syntactical parsing with different running modalities (top-down and bottom-up knowledge activation, left-to-rigth and bidirectional input processing, breadth-first and depth-first search, best-first and beam use of the scoring). We describe the developed modules and the interaction preliminary framework then we present a brief discussion on the use of the system. Some ideas for the further activity are presented.\n",

    "In this paper, we discuss some important problems which we encountered in developing the DmDialog real-time speech-to-speech translation system. DMDlALOG is a real-time Japanese-English speech-to-speech dialog translation system that accepts speaker-independent continuous speech input and produces audio output of translated sentences. It has been publicly demonstrated at the Center for Machine Translation at Carnegie Mellon University since March 1989. Major problems are seen in the areas of (1) integration of linguistic and statistical nautral language processing, (2) use of discourse knowledge to improve speech recognition rates, and (3) attainment of simultaneity in translation. We chose these problems to discuss here because they are very difficult and unique to speech-to-speech translation systems; they are not encountered in text-based machine translaton systems. We describe our approaches to these problems and describe problems left unresolved, so that this paper can serve as a basis for further discussions on these issues.\n",

    "The ESPRIT project 'Integration of Speech Understanding Interfaces ' (SUNSTAR) concentrates on the design of a Dialogue System and the integration of existing off-the-shelf speech input and output devices into a number of practical applications. The communication between the speech I/O devices and a specific application is managed by a Dialogue System, which consists of a number of modules the aim of which are to guide speech activated I/O messages between the user and the application in a user-friendly and meaningful way, to forward user requests to the application, and to send back responses from the application to the user. Furthermore, the Dialogue System is supervising the state of functionality of the entire man-machine system. This paper focuses its attention on the development of the individual modules of the Dialogue System, which consists of the Dialogue Description Language including a common Dialogue Design Tool and an Interpretation and Control Module. The Dialogue Design Tool is an essential part of the Dialogue System. It is used by the Dialogue Developer for assistance during the specification of a specific application dialogue. The SUNSTAR project has partners from industry, telecommunication organisations and universities from five European countries, and the project is focused on establishing a number of practical speech I/O activated applications for the professional and public domains.\n",

In the association index file \"Association Confidence Factor (ACF)\" is introduced to express a directional weight of each link from a source concept to a target concept using a membership function. As it is impossible to assign ACFs on every links among all concepts, the number of links to which ACFs are assigned is limited, so it is required to provide means to give appropriate ACF values for the rest of the links on demand employing available ACFs. A set of formulae is proposed for that purpose. In addition, psychological experiments were conducted to investigate human association activity.\n",

Our approach relies on the following optimality criterion: the best track combination for formant interpretation is the one which explains more energy in terms of formants than any other combination and which satisfies constraints placed upon formants (Fl F2 and F2 F3 compatibility). The algorithm is made up of two distinct steps: - a local formant interpretation in order to determine at each instant the best interpretation, - a global formant interpretation guided by results of the preceding step. The assessment of the global interpretation enables to choose the best formant tracking parameters.\n",

In this study, we extract some glottal wave parameters which does not seem to be susceptible to mimicry and combine them with some LPC vocal tract parameters to make a smaller sized template. In the extraction of feature parameters of glottal wave, the multipulse excitation model is adopted under modifying the pulse search algorithm. According to experimental results obtained from 30 speakers' 5 vowels, 94% identification rate with a template of 10 feature parameters (8 vocal tract and 2 glottal parameters) and 99% with a template of 36 feature parameters (14 vocal tract and 22 glottal parameters) are obtained respectively. In comparison with the number of parameters to get same identification rate only with a formants' template, the number of feature parameters is reduced by 5 in case of getting 94% identification rate and 7 in case of getting 99% identification rate.\n",

    "This research outlines the predominant dialogue and performance characteristics of 3-person interpreted telephone speech during service-oriented dialogues, in comparison with those of 2-person noninterpreted dialogues. An empirical study was conducted in which 12 native English speakers each made one telephone call through an experienced telephone interpreter to a Japanese confederate who did not speak English, and a second call to a Japanese confederate fluent in English. In total, 24 dialogues were collected, each one containing two successfully completed service tasks, or 48 tasks total. This paper reports on comparisons performed between 3-person interpreted and 2-person noninterpreted speech, based on the same pool of tasks and English subjects. The unique characteristics of interpreted telephone dialogues are outlined, including structural and referential features, miscommunications and other performance characteristics, confirmatory language, and linguistic indirection. In addition, a.n analysis is presented of interpreters' strategic management of turn shifts and of the content and sequencing of information passed among speakers. The long-term goal of this exploratory research is the modelling of human speech, and the specification of preliminary target requirements for future automatic systems.\n",

    "The MIT voyager speech understanding system, described in some detail in [1], is an urban exploration system that interacts with the user through spoken dialogue and graphics. This paper describes some recent changes made in the Voyager system, and attempts to assess the effectiveness of these developments. Two key improvements are a tighter integration of the speech and natural language components and a pipelined hardware implementation leading to a speed-up in processing time from approximately 12 times real time to approximately 3 times real time. We have also made a number of incremental improvements in the word-pair grammar, pronunciation networks, and the back-end capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate substantial performance improvements, mainly as a consequence of tighter integration.\n",

    "In order to understand the speech developmental process in infants from birth onwards, and design an instrument suitable to relate early infant sound productions to basic elements of adult speech, we tried to map the sensorimotoric development of the sound producing mechanism and possibly trace any systematics within the process. Subsequently we intend to describe the acoustic aspects of the sound productions within well defined motoric stages.\n",
    "A method to study this developmental process was designed, based on the source-filter model of speech production. Within the framework of the anatomical and physiological capacities of the infant, source activities were described in aspects of phonatory development. Filter activities were represented by developmental aspects of articulatory movements. A breath group was used as a segmentation unit.\n",
    "This method resulted in six clearly recognizable, sensorimotoric developmental stages in the infant's sound productions in the first year of life. Based on these results we tried to mark within the sound productions of one infant in his first year of life, each of the stages I-V by a number of acoustic features.\n",

    "The vocal behaviour of 26 young infants was recorded in order to throw some light on speech acquisition processes. So far, acoustic analyses were carried out for 4 infants aged from 2 to 17 months. Infants were addressed by either their mother, adults unfamiliar to them, or voices presented to them through a loudspeaker. Results were as follows. (1) Even very young infants were able to produce a wide spectrum of speech-like sounds, for example with abrupt F0 changes, or with various voice qualities, characterized by the richness of subharmonic components and of noise components. (2) Mothers tended to use a wider and higher F0 range while speaking to their child than while speaking to adults. (3) Vocal behaviour of infants change according to how and by whom they were spoken to. They produced longer vocalizations in response to their mother's incentive speech, and they did so more often than with other adults.\n",

Word accent pattern, vowel length, voiceless consonant length, nasal consonants and the nasalized vowel were examined. The results showed that word accent pattern was identified better by the subjects of tone languages than the other groups of subjects. Vowel length was identified better than voiceless consonant length, but the difference from their native languages were not found. According to nasals, two types of errors (confusions and omissions & additions) were examined. Compared to the Indonesian subjects, the Chinese and the Thai subjects made more errors of omission & addition, while the Korean subjects made more errors of both types. It is supposed that the monosyllable structure of Chinese and Thai have relation to the errors of omission & addition.\n",

    "This is a review of basic issues in speech analysis with an emphasis on work carried out at the KTH in Stockholm. The concept of the speech code as a knowledge base for speech research and applications is outlined. In a narrow sense the speech code may be substantiated by programs and rules for text-to-speech conversion, in a wider sense also covering speaker type and speaking style and other aspects of a message not inherent in a text. For adequate descriptions we need the support of extensive speech analysis, articulatory modelling and perceptual critera. This is exemplified by a discussion of labial and velar stops in a back vowel context. One aspect of the interaction between prosodic and segmental features is the degree of articulatory and associated spectral contrast which becomes enhanced with increasing stress. A brief review is made of stress correlates based on objective and subjective measures with comments are made on language differences. Interstress intervals do not display physical isochrony but some readers plan their pauses to integrate in rhythmical synchrony with a perceived local average stress rate, The average pause-to-speech ratio is a speaker specific characteristic.\n",

    "This paper summarizes recent findings on the effects of talker variability on speech perception. The results of several experiments demonstrate that detailed information about a talker is encoded into multi-layered representations in long-term memory. These representations appear to be much more detailed than the canonical symbolic representations of speech that linguists have traditionally assumed. The representations also appear to be highly context-dependent and apparently preserve a great deal of information in the speech signal. The usefulness of these representations for optimal strategies of lexical access is discussed.\n",

    "Since the invention of a speech analysis-synthesis system based on the maximum likelihood(ML) spectrum estimation in 1966 by Shuzo Saito and the author, research and development of efficient speech coding methods and their applications to computer and communication systems have been actively conducted in Japan. Our interest in LPC speech coding goes back to 1965 when I was looking for new research project for the graduate study at Nagoya University, after finishing the master degree on time series analysis of the bio-medical signals. At that time, an excellent book \"Speech Analysis Synthesis and Perception\" by Jim Flanagan was just printed and a review paper on vocoders by Manfred Schroeder was published in a short time later. Previous efforts to encode speech signal were well summarized in these documents. After examining these, I was convinced that the most fundamental problem in speech processing to achieve efficient speech coding and speech recognition, is to extract the spectral information from speech waveform as accurately and efficiently as possible. Accordingly, I tried to attack the problem from the view point of a statistical analysis of stationary random processes. The first outcome was the maximum likelihood (ML) spectral estimation of the all-pole spectrum. This method was motivated by the profound results on the hypothesis testing in time series analysis by Peter Whittle. The second outcome was the partial autocorrelation (PARCOR) analysis. The statistial concept of the partial autocorrelation was introduced to speech analysis, and the resulting lattice structure for the analysis and synthesis filter has now been widely used for general speech processing. The third development is the line spectrum pair(LSP) representation of speech spectrum. The concept of LSP was motivated by the work of Ya. L. Geronimus on the orthogonal polynomials on a circle (1948).\n",
    "In this talk, I would like to present a historical retrospective of the early developments of LPC speech analysis and coding techniques and their impacts on the recent developments of new generation speech coding methods and speech recognition.\n",
