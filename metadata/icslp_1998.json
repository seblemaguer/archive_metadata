    "This paper describes two related systems which provide frameworks for encoding linguistic knowledge into formal rules within the context of a trainable probabilistic model. The first system, TINA, drives top-down from sentence level structure, terminating in either words or syllables. It's main purpose is to provide a meaning representation for the sentence. The other system, ANGIE, operates bottom-up from phonetic or orthographic units, characterizing word substructure. It provides a framework for both phonological rule modelling and letter-to-sound/sound-to-letter transformations. The two systems logically converge on the syllable or word layer. We have recently been successful in integrating their combined constraint into a recognizer search, achieving considerable improvement in understanding accuracy. In this paper, I will look both toward the past and the future, identifying and motivating the decisions that were made in the design of TINA and ANGIE and the associated rule formalisms, and contemplating various remaining open research issues.\n",

    "A new model of phone duration and energy is presented. These parameters are modelled in two stages. The first stage builds a statistics tree that contains phone duration and energy mean and standard deviation values at each node. The branches of the tree are characterised by a set of factors related to phonetic context. The second stage considers phone duration and energy to be modified by two syllable-level prosodic coefficients. The duration and energy of the phones of a syllable are influenced to differing degrees by these coefficients. Weights are associated with the different phone positions in a syllable. A simulated annealing technique is used to find the set of weights that allow the prosodic coefficients to be calculated for all syllables and, in turn, minimise the error in predicting the phone duration and energy during synthesis. They are predicted with a mean squared error of 15.4ms and 6.8dB respectively. During synthesis, the syllable-level prosodic coefficients are predicted by regression trees from linguistic information. Manual prosodic labelling is not required at any stage.\n",

    "Accurate duration modeling is necessary for synthetic speech to sound natural. Over the past few years, the sums-of-products framework has emerged as an effective way to account for contextual influences on phoneme duration. This approach is generally applied after log-transforming the durations. This paper presents empirical and theoretical evidence which suggests that this transformation is not optimal. A promising alternative solution is proposed, based on a root sinusoidal function. Preliminary experimental results were obtained on over 50,000 phonemes in varied prosodic contexts. Compared to the log transformation, this new transformation reduced the proportion of standard deviation unexplained by approximately 30%. Alternatively, for a given level of performance, the root sinusoidal transformation roughly halved the number of regression parameters required.\n",

In the synthesis stage, state durations are determined by using the state duration models. In this paper, we take account of contextual factors such as stress-related factors and locational factors in addition to phone identity factors. Experimental results show that we can synthesize good quality speech with natural timing, and the speaking rate can be varied easily.\n",

    "This paper reports on work developing an accent-independent lexicon for use in synthesising speech in English. Developing a lexicon for a new accent is a long process, and one potential solution to this problem involves the encoding of regional variation by means of keywords; so, rather than transcribing different phonemes for 'pool' in RP and in Scottish accents, we can simply say that the word contains the same vowel as in the keyword GOOSE. However, there are a number of theoretical and practical issues, which are discussed here. It is proposed that phonemic variation within accents be encoded in the lexicon by use of keyword symbols, while allophonic differences be derived by accent-specific rules. If we wish to include some stylistic variation this makes the lexicon more comprehensive but more complex. Finally, it is noted that even in keyword synthesis exception lists cannot be avoided.\n",

The aim of the filter dictionary was to provide a lexicon that was compact, fast and had broader coverage than the standard dictionary used to create it. Correct phonemic transcriptions and lexical stress assignment were both required for a transcription to be deemed accurate. The approach taken here guarantees 100% accurate coverage of the original dictionary, but also gives 93% accurate transcription of the expected coverage of novel words. Lexical stress and the phonemic transcription were retrieved in one pass, resulting in an extremely fast system. We also allowed user-definition to retain accuracy for non-standard transcriptions. This algorithm was developed for British English, but could be applied to other languages.\n",

    "The speech synthesis system described in this paper uses a set of speaker-dependent decision-tree state-clustered hidden Markov models to automatically generate a leaf level segmentation of a large single-speaker continuous-read-speech database. During synthesis, the phone sequence to be synthesised is converted to an acoustic leaf sequence by descending the HMM decision trees. Duration, energy and pitch values are predicted using separate trainable models. To determine the segment sequence to concatenate, a dynamic programming (d.p.) search is performed over all the waveform segments aligned to each leaf in training. The d.p. attempts to ensure that the selected segments join each other spectrally, and have durations, energies and pitches such that the amount of degradation introduced by the subsequent use of TD-PSOLA is minimised; the selected segments are concatenated and modified to have the required prosodic values using TD-PSOLA. The d.p. results in the system effectively selecting variable length units.\n",

Naturalness achieved by structural richness produces a perceptually robust signal intelligible in adverse listening conditions. ProSynth uses syntactic and phonological parses to model the fine acoustic-phonetic detail of real speech, segmentally, temporally and intonationally.\n",

The total quality evaluation includes speech intelligibility test at different levels (syllable, word and sentence), speech naturalness test and anti-interference ability test for phonetic module and text processing ability test for linguistic module. The designing principle of testing materials and testing methods are briefly described and the test results of four text-to-speech (TTS) systems for Chinese are presented in this paper. It is shown that 1. All professional technicians joining the speech naturalness test with the testing crew together overestimated the overall quality of the four tested systems; 2. The word intelligibility and Semantically Unpredicted Sentence (SUS) score are good for evaluating speech synthesis systems; 3. The anti-interference ability of synthetic speech is rather weak about 20 per cent in syllable intelligibility lower than natural speech under condition of S/N=5dB.\n",

Sentences of different types were synthesized by six German synthesis systems. The synthetic utterances and one human voice were comparatively judged by experienced listeners.

Two additional sentences were formed from each sentence pair by transplanting the prosodic structure between the natural and synthetic members of each pair. In two listening experiments subjects were asked to (a) classify each sentence as \"natural\" or \"synthetic, or (b) rate the naturalness of each sentence.

    "This paper addresses the topic of performing effective concatenative speech synthesis with a limited database by proposing methods to smooth the transitions between speech segments. The objective is to produce natural-sounding speech via segment concatenation when formants and other spectral features do not align properly. We propose several methods for adjusting the spectra between waveform segments selected for concatenation. Techniques examined include optimal coupling, waveform interpolation, linear predictive pole shifting, and psychoacoustic closure. Several of these algorithms have been previously developed for either coding or synthesis, but our application of closure for segment processing is novel. After spectral smoothing, the final synthesized speech can better approximate the desired speech characteristics and is continuous in both the time domain and spectral structure.\n",

    "Phonetic transcriptions are often manually encoded in a pronunciation lexicon. This process is time consuming and requires linguistic expertise. Moreover, it is very difficult to maintain consistency. To handle these problems, we present a model that produces Korean pronunciation variants based on morphophonological analysis. By analyzing phonological variations frequently found in spoken Korean, we have derived about 800 phonemic contexts that would trigger the applications of the corresponding phonemic and allophonic rules. In generating pronunciation variants, morphological analysis is preceded to handle variations of phonological words. According to the morphological category, a set of finite state automata tables reflecting phonemic context is looked up to generate pronunciation variants. Our experiments show that the proposed model produces mostly correct pronunciation variants of phonological words consisting of several morphemes.\n",

    "We describe techniques used in the development of a high-accuracy automatic annotation system designed to provide new voices for a concatenative speech synthesiser. We have used standard HMM-based \"forced alignment\" techniques and have concentrated on refining both acoustic and pronunciation modelling to achieve greater alignment accuracy. Acoustic models were improved by Bayesian speaker adaptation and the use of confidence measures from N-Best decodings to produce speaker dependent HMM's. Pronunciation modelling improvements involved the use of a large pronunciation dictionary containing multiple pronunciations for many words, use of pronunciation probabilities, accommodation of interword silences and using information derived from existing manual annotations to guide the recogniser during decoding. The system produces time-aligned phonetic alignments for UK accents in which the automatic and manual alignments agree on the segmental labelling 93% of the time and in which the boundaries have an r.m.s. error of 14.5 ms from the manual boundary.\n",

    "The lack of naturalness hampers the widespread application of speech synthesis. Increasing the size of the unit database in a concatenative speech synthesizer has been proposed as a method to increase the variety of units-thereby improving naturalness. However, expanding the unit database increases the computational cost of selecting the most appropriate unit and compounds the risk that a perceptually suboptimal unit is chosen. Clustering the unit database prior to synthesis is an effective method for reducing this cost and risk. In this study, a unit selection method based on tree-structured clustering of data is implemented and evaluated. This approach to tree construction differs from similar approaches used in both synthesis and recognition in that a \"right-sized\" tree is found automatically rather than using hand-tuned stopping criteria. The tree is grown to its maximum size, and its leaves are systematically recombined in order to determine the most suitable subtree. Trees are grown using the automatic stopping method and compared with those grown using thresholds. Cross validation shows that trees grown to their maximum size and systematically recombined produce fuller clusters with lower objective distortion measures than trees whose growth is arrested by a threshold. The study concludes with a discussion of how these results may affect the perceptual quality of a speech synthesizer.\n",

    "A solution is proposed for rapidly adapting prosodic models to a new voice or a new application. First, a prosodic alphabet that is supported by linguistic knowledge is identified at the acoustic level. The observation of the realisation of prosodic events on the acoustic corpus allows classes of breaks, F0 shapes and accents to be constructed and automatic transcription rules to be written. Then the transcribed corpus is used in the estimation of the parameters of a prosodic model for French. The good F0 contours and duration generated with the prosodic model verify the agreement of the identified alphabets to describe prosodic phenomena. Finally, the prosodic model is integrated in the CNET standard French Text-to-Speech Synthesis system. The quality of the generated prosody is considered by naive listeners as equivalent to the handcrafted system. This result verifies the appropriateness of the alphabet as prosodic descriptors.\n",

Finally, diphones found in the corpus were compared to units of a synthesis database to validate both the normalisation and transcription modules and the synthesis unit database.\n",

Our first aim is to provide some statistics based on scripted read speech since past studies mainly dealt with spontaneous speech. The second aim is to investigate whether the clause structure is a reliable indication of the tone unit. We start with a description of the annotation of transcribed speech data selected from the Spoken English Corpus (SEC), which is tagged for detailed wordclass information with AUTASYS and then parsed for rich syntactic description with the Survey Parser. Prosodic annotations in SEC, including both major and minor tone unit boundaries, were then mapped onto the parse trees. We then present our observations of tone units in the light of the clause structure. The paper will demonstrate that there is an overall correspondence between the clause structure and the tone unit in the sense that tone units generally co-start with the clause and that they seldom occur at major clause element junctures.\n",

The representative vectors are selected from the F0 contour codebook, which is designed so as to minimize the approximation error between F0 contours generated by the proposed model and real F0 contours extracted from a speech corpus. It was confirmed by experiments with Japanese speech corpus that F0 contours can be modeled with small approximation errors by only 48 representative vectors, and the synthetic speech sounded very natural and resembled the prosodic characteristics of the original speaker.\n",

    "For the purpose of constructing prosodic rules for dialogue speech synthesis, a comparative study was conducted on speech rates between dialogue speech and read speech. Based on the generation modeling of F0 contour, we can define 4 prosodic units, such as prosodic sentence, prosodic phrase and so on. Speech rate was analyzed with respect to these units. In a prosodic sentence, dialogue speech starts with a speech rate similar to that of read speech. The speech rate then gradually increases and, after passing through the middle of the unit, decreases towards the end. Similar tendencies were also observed in lower level units, but the degree of speech rate change in a unit was smaller. Based on the above results, a preliminary rules for speech rate control were developed for dialogue speech synthesis. A hearing test showed that the developed rules could make the synthetic speech sound more dialogue-like.\n",

We have examined this hypothesis by correlating the results of a listening experiment with spectral distances measured across diphone boundaries. The aim is to find a spectral distance measure that best predicts when discontinuities are audible in order to find out how the diphone database can best be extended with context-sensitive diphones. The results show that the Kullback-Leibler measure is the best predictor.\n",

With the confidence measure the suspected errors can be identified such that manual inspection loads can be largely reduced for non-real-time applications.

    "The Multi-layered Speech/Sound Synthesis Control Language (MSCL) proposed herein facilitates the synthesizing of several speech modes such as nuance, mental state and emotion, and allows speech to be synchronized to other media easily. MSCL is a multi-layered linguistic system and encompasses three layers: and semantic level layer (The S-layer), interpretation level layer (The I-layer), and parameter level layer (The P-layer). The S-layer is the description level of semantics such as emotional and emphasized speech. The I-layer is the description level of prosodic feature controls and interprets The S-layer scripts to for control on I-layer level. The P-layer represents prosodic parameters for speech synthesis. This multi-level description system is convenient for both laymen and professional users. MSCL also encompasses many effective prosodic feature control functions such as a time-varying pattern description function, absolute and relative control forms, and SDS(Speaker Dependent Scale). MSCL enables more emotional and expressive synthetic speech than conventional TTS systems. This paper describes these functions and the effective prosodic feature controls possible with MSCL.\n",

The advantage of using the advanced word database is that a variety of VCV-segments with the same phonetic chains and the different pitch patterns could be collected efficiently at the same time. The following pitch modification techniques are used to achieve the sound quality: (1) The optimal VCV-segment set which minimizes the pitch modification rate is selected. (2) Pitch waveforms are extracted by referring to excitation points. (3) Wavelengths of pitch waveforms are adjusted depending on the pitch modification rates. (4) Natural prosody in the VCV-segments in the database is effectively used. Superiority of the proposed database is ensured by means of the pitch pattern matching measurement and the subjective quality evaluation.\n",

    "This paper presents trainable methods for generating letter to sound rules from a given lexicon for use in pronouncing out-of-vocabulary words and as a method for lexicon compression. As the relationship between a string of letters and a string of phonemes representing its pronunciation for many languages is not trivial, we discuss two alignment procedures, one fully automatic and one hand-seeded which produce reasonable alignments of letters to phones. Top Down Induction Tree models are trained on the aligned entries. We show how combined phoneme/stress prediction is better than separate prediction processes, and still better when including in the model the last phonemes transcribed and part of speech information. For the lexicons we have tested, our models have a word accuracy (including stress) of 78% for OALD, 62% for CMU and 94% for BRULEX. The extremely high scores on the training sets allow substantial size reductions (more than 1/20). WWW site: http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrdico\n",

In order to generate rules for our synthesis scheme, data was collected by analyzing the readings of ten speakers, five males and five females. Our system is used in several applications.

    "The linguistic features analysis for input text plays an important role in achieving natural prosodic control in text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In a conventional scheme, experts refine suspicious if-then rules and change the tree structure manually to obtain correct analysis results when input texts that have been analyzed incorrectly. However, altering the tree structure drastically is difficult since attention is often paid only to the suspicious if-then rules. If earlier rule-tree structure is inappropriate, any attempt to improve the performance may be limited by the stiffness of the structure. To cope with these problems, the new development scheme generates analysis rules by using C4.5 [1], where an if-then rule-tree structure is generated by off-line training. The scheme has the advantage that since the generated rule-tree structure is simple, the rules are easier to maintain. The scheme is applied to generating four types of analysis rule-trees: rules for forming accent phrases, rules for determining accent position, rules for analyzing syntactic structure, and rules for pause insertion. An experimental evaluation was performed on these four rules. The accuracy was 96.5 percent for the accent phrase formation, 95.5 percent for the accent positioning, 87.0 percent for the pause insertion, and 88.3 percent for the syntactic analysis despite using small training data. These results indicate the validity of the scheme. The new scheme is used for developing linguistic features analysis rules in a Japanese TTS system, TOS Drive TTS [3].\n",

    "This paper proposes a new method that determines segmental duration for text-to-speech conversion based on the movement of articulatory organs which compose an articulatory model. The articulatory model comprises four time-variable articulatory parameters representing the conditions of articulatory organs whose physical restriction seems to significantly influence the segmental duration. The parameters are controlled according to an input sequence of phonetic symbols, following which segmental duration is determined based on the variation of the articulatory parameters. The proposed method is evaluated through an experiment using a Japanese speech database that consists of 150 phonetically balanced sentences. The results indicate that the mean square error of predicted segmental duration is approximately 15[ms] for the closed set and 15-17[ms] for the open set. The error is within 20[ms], the level of acceptability for distortion of segmental duration without loss of naturalness, and hence the method is proved to effectively predict segmental duration.\n",

The text analysis component consists of four main parts: the morphological analysis module, the language models, the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules, and the prosodic module. The system is built in a pipeline architecture, the output of which feeds the subsequent synthesis modules. The originality of this work lies in the fact that we use weighted finite-state transducer technology to process the entire analysis of the French system. Moreover, the implementation not only accounts for most orthographic representations, such as numerals, abbreviations, dates, currencies, etc, but we also solve the hard questions of French liaison, mute e, and aspirated h using refined intermediate representations either in the form of traces or in the form of archigraphemes.\n",

    "This paper presents our research efforts on Chinese text-to-speech towards higher naturalness. The main results can be summarized as follows: 1. In the proposed TTS system the syllable-sized units were cut out from the real recorded speech, the synthetic speech was generated by concatenating these units back together. 2. The integration of units synthesized by rules with natural units was tested. A LMA filter based synthesizer was developed successfully to test and generate those units, which were difficult to be collected from the speech corpus. 3. A new efficient Chinese character coding scheme - \"Yin Xu Code\"(YX Code) has been developed to assist the GB Code . With the YX Code a new lexicon structure was designed up. The new dictionary system not only supplies with the pronunciation information, but also is much helpful for the words-segmentation. Based on above results, a Chinese text-to-speech system named as \"KD-863\" has been developed. The system converts any Chinese written text to speech in real time with high naturalness. In the national assessment of Chinese TTS systems held at the end of March 1998 in Beijing, the system achieved a first of the naturalness MOS (Mean Opinion Score).\n",

    "This paper describes a method for selecting units from a database of recorded speech, for use in a concatenative speech synthesiser. The simplest approach is to store one example of every possible unit. A more powerful method is to have multiple examples of each unit. The challenge for such a method is to provide an efficient means of selecting units from a practical inventory, to give the best approximation to the desired sequence in some clearly specified way. The method used in BT's Laureate system uses mixed N-phone units. In theory such units could be of arbitrary size, but in practice they are constrained to a maximum of three phones. It dynamically generates the unit sequence based on a global cost. Units are selected using purely phonologically motivated criteria, without reference to acoustic features, either desired or available within the inventory.\n",

    "It is often difficult to determine the suitability of a speaker to serve as a model for concatenative text-to-speech synthesis. The perceived quality of a speaker's natural voice is not necessarily predictive of its synthetic quality. The selection of female and male speakers on whom to base two synthetic voices for the new AT&T text-to-speech system was made empirically. Brief readings of identical text materials were recorded from professional speakers. Small-scale TTS systems were constructed with a minimal diphone inventory, suitable for synthesizing a limited number of test sentences. Synthesized sentences and their naturally spoken references were presented to listeners in a formal listening evaluation. In addition, a variety of acoustic measurements of the speakers were made in order to determine which acoustic characteristics correlated with subjective synthesis quality. The results have implications both for speaker selection and for improving concatenative synthesis methods.\n",

    "In concatenative synthesis, new utterances are created by concatenating segments (units) of recorded speech. When the segments are extracted from a large speech corpus, a key issue is to select segments that will sound natural in a given phonetic context. Distance measures are often used for this task. However, little is known about the perceptual relevance of these measures. More insight into the relationship between computed distances and perceptual differences is needed to develop accurate unit selection algorithms, and to improve the quality of the resulting computer speech. In this paper, we develop a perceptual test to measure subtle phonetic differences between speech units. We use the perceptual data to evaluate several popular distance measures. The results show that distance measures that use frequency warping perform better than those that do not, and minimal extra advantage is gained by using weighted distances or delta features.\n",

We represent speech as being composed of a number of frames, where each frame can be synthesized from a parameter vector. Each frame is represented by a state in an HMM, where the output distribution of each state is a Gaussian random vector consisting of x and Dx. The set of vectors that maximizes the HMM probability is the representation of the smoothed speech output. This technique follows our traditional goal of developing methods whose parameters are automatically learned from data with minimal human intervention. The general framework is demonstrated to be robust by maintaining improved quality with a significant reduction in data.\n",

We apply this observation about F0 contours to a speech segmentation method. The DF0 segmentation parameter is used in the final stage of the segmentation procedure to refine the phonemic boundaries roughly obtained by DP alignment.

    "In this study a data-based approach to intonation modeling is presented. The model incorporates knowledge from intonation theories like the expected types of F0 movements and syllable anchoring. The knowledge is integrated into the model using an appropriate approximation function for F0 parametrization. The F0 parameters that result from the parametrization are predicted from a set of features using neural nets. The quality of the generated contours is assessed by means of numerical measures and perception tests. They show that the basic hypotheses about intonation description and modeling are in principle correct and that they have the potential to be successfully applied to speech synthesis. We argue for a clear interface with a linguistic description (using pitch-accent and boundary labels as input) and discourse structure (using pitch-range normalized F0 parameters).\n",

    "We have developed an educational environment for a modular spoken dialogue system. The aim of the environment is to provide students, with different backgrounds, means to understand the behaviour of spoken dialogue systems. Focus in this paper is on dialogue and dialogue management. The dialogue is recorded in a dialogue tree whose nodes are dialogue objects. The dialogue objects model the constituents of the dialogue and consist of parameters for modelling dialogue structure, focus structure and a process description describing the actions of the dialogue system. Various dialogue system behaviours can be achieved by modifying these parameters. This is done using the educational environment, which is interactive and facilitates examination, expansion and modification of the dialogue object parameters and hence the system. The educational system has been used in a number of courses at various universities in Sweden.\n",

    "In the EC funded research project REWARD professionals in the target domain for a dialogue system were enabled to develop their own speech driven telephone service (dialogue system). Specialists in speech recognition technology provided them with graphical tools and technical advice. Guided by their in-depth understanding of the target domain and target user the four user partners developed four different dialogue systems. The shift of focus in the dialogue system design process from technology to end user driven design 'rationale' is influenced by research into the design process of dialogue systems and provides valuable data that informs user-centred-design processes of interactive systems. In this paper we report on observations with regard to this end-user driven design process. Dialogue features, which are a direct result of this different approach to designing speech recognition applications, are presented.\n",

    "In some dialogue systems, the design of dialogue strategy is bound tightly to the domain by straightforwardly hard-coding the response actions into the system. Such a paradigm is quite easy to build up a prototype system, but makes it difficult to port the system across different domains. This paper presents a domain-transparent design of dialogue management to increase system portability. The basic idea of this framework is to extract the domain-dependent factors to form an external domain knowledge database, leaving the dialogue management component independent of the tasks. Based on the proposed framework, porting to another domain needs only to replace the domain knowledge database without changing the dialogue management module. This paper also proposed a task description table interface enabling system developers to design the dialogue strategy flexibly. With this approach, the effort of porting a spoken dialogue system across different domains can be relieved.\n",

It integrates spoken and written language processing through cooperation of a spoken dialogue component and an OCR which extracts handwritten information from application forms. b. It reads the forms and calls the applicants (instead of being called by them) in order to collect the missing information through a continuous speech, full sentence, machine-driven dialogue which allows the user to formulate his answers at will. The system has been developed for a Greek car insurance company in the framework of the EU-project: LE-1 1802, ACCeSS, but can be easily adapted to a different call centre application.

    "This paper reports our progress in building a mixed initiative, goal-oriented dialogue system for human machine interactions. The dialogue model embraces the spirits of the so-called plan-based approach in that the dialogue flow is not statically authored but dynamically generated by the system as a natural outcome of the semantic evaluation process. With multimodal applications in mind, the dialogue system is designed in an event driven architecture that is commonly seen in the core of a graphical user interface (GUI) environment. In the same manner that GUI events are handled by graphical objects, the proposed dialogue model assigns dialogue events to semantic objects that encapsulate the knowledge for handling events under various discourse contexts. Currently, we have found that four types of events, namely, dialogue object instantiation, semantic evaluation, dialogue repair, and discourse binding, are sufficient for a wide range of applications.\n",

The idea is to cluster several dialogue contexts into a class and to create for each class a specific language model. We present an automatic algorithm based on the minimal decrease of mutual information which clusters the dialogue contexts. Moreover the algorithm is able to guess an appropriate number of classes, that gives a good trade off between the mutual information and the amount of training data. Therefore the automatic classification allows the full automatic creation of context-dependent language models for a spoken dialogue system.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a trainable system that can automatically identify the command boundaries in a conversational natural language user interface. The proposed solution makes the conversational interface much more user friendly, and allows the user to speak naturally and continuously in a hands-free manner. The main ingredient of the system is the maximum entropy identification model, which is trained using data that has all the correct command boundaries marked. During training, a set of features and their weights are selected iteratively using the training data. The features consists of words and phrases, as well as their relative position to the potential command boundaries. Decoding is done by examining the product of the weights for the features that are present. We also propose several enhancements to the approach, such as combining it with a more effective language model at the speech recognition stage to generate additional tokens for the identification model. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the proposed approach, and the results are described.\n",

    "Recognizing the dialogue act(s) performed by means of an utterance involves combining top-down expectations about the next likely `move' in a dialogue with bottom-up information extracted from the speech signal. We compared two ways of generating expectations: one which makes the expectations depend only on the previous act (as in a bigram model), and one which also takes into account the fact that individual dialogue acts play a role as part of larger conversational structures (`games'). Our models were built by training over the HCRC MapTask corpus using the LTG implementation of maximum entropy estimation. We achieved an accuracy of 38.6% using bigrams, of 50.6% taking game structure into account; adding information about speaker change resulted in an accuracy of 41.8% with bigrams, 54% with game structure. These results indicate that exploiting game structure does lead to improved expectations.\n",

In this paper we describe our time sensitive conversational architecture for turn taking that not only allows alternating turns and barge in, but other conversational behaviors as well. This architecture allows backchanneling, prompting the user by taking more than one turn if necessary, and overlapping speech. The architecture is implemented in a Reading Tutor that listens to children read aloud, and helps them. We extended this architecture to allow the Reading Tutor to interrupt the student based on a non-self-corrected mistake - \"content-driven interruption\". To the best of our knowledge, the Reading Tutor is thus the first spoken language system to intentionally interrupt the user based on the content of the utterance.\n",

    "The study reported in this paper focuses on different functions of echoing in Japanese dialogues. Echoing is defined as a speaker's lexical repeat of (parts of) an utterance spoken by a conversation partner in a previous turn. The phenomenon was investigated in three task-oriented, informal dialogues. Repeats in this corpus were labeled in terms of a 5-point scale which expressed the level to which a speaker had integrated the other person's utterance into his/her own body of knowledge. Kappa statistics showed that the labels could reliably be reproduced by three independent subjects. The investigation brought to light that the level of integration is reflected in a number of lexical and prosodic correlates. These features are discussed regarding their information potential, i.e., their accuracy and comprehensiveness as signals.\n",

The dialogue task selected consists of telephone shopping, and human-machine dialogues using Wizard-of-OZ method were collected for analysis. The results show that back-channel feedbacks and brief confirmations by our spoken dialogue system, prompt more utterances from and give more satisfaction to users. Second, users tend to give back-channel feedbacks whenever the system gives them feedbacks.

    "Within the EC SQEL project, the German EVAR spoken dialogue system has been extended to handle four different languages and domains: German, Slovak, and Czech (national train connections), and Slovenian (European flights). The SQEL demonstrator can also access databases on the WWW, enabling users without an internet connection to meet their information needs by just using the phone. When the system starts up, the caller is free to use any of the implemented languages. A multilingual word recognizer implicitly identifies the language, which is then associated with the appropriate domain and database. For the remainder of the dialogue, the corresponding monolingual recognizer is employed. The existence of language-independent parameters (e.g. goal/source location) has meant that porting the system to a new language does not involve an extensive restructuring of the interpretation process within the Dialogue Manager. This is sufficiently flexible to switch between the different domains and languages.\n",

    "Structured dialogue models are currently the only tools for easily building spoken dialogue systems. This approach, however, requires the dialogue designer to completely specify all dialogue behavior between the user and system, including how information is grounded between the user and the system. In this paper, we advocate factoring out the grounding behavior from structured dialogue models by using a general purpose dialogue manager that accounts for this behavior. This not only simplifies the specification of dialogue, but also allows more powerful mechanisms of grounding to be employed, which cannot be implemented within the framework of structured dialogues.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a robust processing model of spoken dialogue. Our dialogue model is a cognitive process model (1) which integrates stepwise processing from utterance understanding to response generation, (2) which specifies the interactions between the processing of each steps and two level dialogue management mechanism, and (3) which identifies the possible errors caused by speech recognition error and specifies the method of recovering from the error. Also, We examined the validity of this model using new evaluation paradigm: system-to-system dialogue with linguistic noise. By this evaluation, the robustness of proposed cognitive process model is shown in relatively low recognition error situation.\n",

    "This paper presents a context-based analysis of the intervals between different speakers' utterances in a corpus of task-oriented dialogue (the Human Communication Research Centre's Map Task Corpus). In the analysis, we assessed the relationship between inter-speaker intervals and various contextual factors, such as the effects of eye contact, the presence of conversational game boundaries, the category of move in an utterance, and the degree of experience with the task in hand. The results of the analysis indicated that the main factors which gave rise to significant differences in inter-speaker intervals were those which related to decision-making and planning - the greater the amount of planning, the greater the inter-speaker interval. Differences between speakers were also found to be significant, although this effect did not necessarily interact with all other effects. These results provide unique and useful data for the improved effectiveness of dialogue systems.\n",

In the light of the positive results we obtained for this, we began to develop a more advanced system, with the aim of investigating how spoken dialogue systems might best be tailored to help language learning. The issue we focussed on was the kind of feedback on errors which might be most useful to the learner. We show the types of feedback we have considered, and highlight some of the problems associated with providing different types of feedback.\n",

Comparing and evaluating different strategies is a difficult task, which often remains unexplored, because in most cases evaluation approaches require a unified database structure and efficient integration of data from several disparate sources and forms. To avoid this problem, we implemented two dialog strategy versions within the same general platform. We investigate qualitative and quantitative criteria for evaluation of these dialog control strategies: in particular, by testing the efficiency of our system with and without automatic mechanisms for guiding the user via suggestive prompts. An evaluation phase has been carried out to assess the utility of guiding the user with 32 naive and experienced subjects. The experiments show that user guidance is appropriate for novices and appreciated by all users.\n",

    "This paper introduces a paradigm for designing multimodal dialogue systems. An example system task of the system is to retrieve particular information about different shops in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, such as their names, addresses and phone numbers. The system accepts speech and screen touching as input, and presents retrieved information on a screen display. The speech recognition part is modeled by the FSN (finite state network) consisting of keywords and fillers, both of which are implemented by the DAWG (directed acyclic word-graph) structure. The number of keywords is 306, consisting of district names and business names. The fillers accept roughly 100,000 non-keywords/phrases occuring in spontaneous speech. A variety of dialogue strategies are designed and evaluated based on an objective cost function having a set of actions and states as parameters. Expected dialogue cost is calculated for each strategy, and the best strategy is selected according to the keyword recognition accuracy.\n",

On the basis of corpus analysis, We have made direction-giving dialog system which adjust the pace of dialog using only prosodic information without using speech recognition; no word recognition was used. We contrived a method to evaluate a dialog system talking to human naturally with prosodic information. To evaluate the naturalness of dialog made by our system, we made three experiment with 10 subjects each. The system accomplished natural dialog, and most of subjects weren't aware that it was a computer. This fact, that reasonably good performance was obtained by paying attention to prosodic information alone, indicates the utility of using prosody in producing appropriate timing in dialog.

On three scenario-based tasks, novice users who had the tutorial had task completion times and user satisfaction ratings that were comparable to those of expert users. Novices who did not experience the tutorial had significantly longer task completion times on the initial task, but similar completion times to the tutorial group on the final task. User satisfaction ratings of the no-tutorial group were consistently lower than the ratings of the other two groups. Evaluation using the PARADISE framework indicated that perceived task completion, mean recognition score, and number of help requests were significant predictors of user satisfaction with the system.\n",

    "This paper proposes a new dialogue management architecture for human-machine speech communication systems. In our daily speech communication, incremental, non-deterministic and quick-response behaviors are required for effortless information interchange. Emergent computational architectures, proposed in the robot control domain, are promising to enable such features. The dialogue manager (ECL-DIALOG) consists of multiple \"phrase pattern\" detectors as input sensors. The CFG driven phrase detectors search for phrase patterns in user utterances and generates numerous emergent slot-filling signals. The system integrates them according to their \"phrase pattern\" priorities and updates the current task-completion context. When a slot value is updated, the system generates an appropriate response. For example, when the system finds a new slot value from user utterances, the system generates a chiming utterance \"yeah\". When the context slot is replaced by a different value \"Tuesday\" that has a lower priority, the system asks for confirmation \"On Tuesday?\".\n",

State transition methods have been recommended for dialogues that involve well-structured tasks that can be mapped directly on to a dialogue structure. However, other significant factors to be considered include the structure of the information to be transacted and the need for verification of the user's input as determined by the system's level of recognition accuracy.

    "In this paper, we present a general framework and architecture for maintaining dialogue coordination in spoken dialogue systems, in which intended behaviors and goals are incrementally performed during the course of maintaining dialogue coordination. The dialogue structure emerges as a result from interaction between user and the dialogue system. The key feature of this design for the systems is to use multiple situated-agents for coordinating communicative acts that are realized as a hierarchy of autonomous behaviors by using a subsumption architecture. In this architecture it should be noted that the lower-level behaviors act autonomously for maintaining the dialogue coordination and are linked to the specifications from higher-level behaviors for dialogue management. In order to make the behavior of the system social, in general, the maintaining of dialogue coordination takes priority over the realization of intended goals of the system as a dialogue participant. We introduce an under-specification strategy for controlling the preference of the concurrent behaviors. This is in contrast to the classical, top-down approach to dialogue coordination.\n",

    "In a spoken dialogue system, the intention is the most important component for speech understanding. In this paper, we propose a corpus-based hidden Markov model (HMM) to model the intention of a sentence. Each intention is represented by a sequence of word segment categories determined by a task-specific lexicon and a corpus. In the training procedure, five intention HMM's are defined, each representing one intention in our approach. In the intention identification process, the phrase sequence is fed to each intention HMM. Given a speech utterance, the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most likely intention sequences. The intention HMM considers not only the phrase frequency but also the syntactic and semantic structure in a phrase sequence. In order to evaluate the proposed method, a spoken dialogue model for air travel information service is investigated. The experiments were carried out using a test database from 25 speakers (15 male and 10 female). There are 120 dialogues, which contain 725 sentences in the test database. The experimental results show that the correct response rate can achieve about 80.3% using intention HMM.\n",

    "This paper describes a Wizard of Oz (WOZ) system that allows the realistic simulation of a multimodal spoken language system. A Wizard protocol has been drawn up which means that the WOZ system will simulate the limitations of an automatic system rather than allow the user to engage in the full range of human-human dialogue. In support of this protocol is a sophisticated Wizard response panel and underlying response generation functionality. This enables the Wizard to respond to complex multimodal inputs in near real-time. The chosen application is a 3D retail service, in which users can select furnishings from a database according to colour, pattern, fabric type, etc., transfer furnishings to objects in a virtual showroom, ask about prices and matching of fabrics, etc. The system includes a \"virtual assistant\", i.e. a synthetic persona which speaks the verbal system output. Users make their input by a combination of fluent speech and touchscreen input. The paper describes a formal trial carried out with the WOZ system, and discusses the results.\n",

    "This paper presents a syllable-based Chinese spoken dialogue system for telephone directory services primarily trained with a corpus. It integrates automatic phrase extraction, robust phrase spotting, statistics-based semantic parsing by phrase-concept joint language model as well as concept-based dialogue model, and intention identification by probabilistic finite state network to form a speech intention estimator. By applying the proposed techniques, the concept sequence with the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) probability based on intra and inter sentence consideration conveyed in the user's speech sentence, i.e. the speaker's intention, can be identified. This approach is convenient to be trained by a given corpus and flexible to be ported to different dialogue tasks. Incorporate a mixed-initiative goal-oriented dialogue manager, we have successfully developed a dialogue system for telephone directory service. Very promising results have been obtained in on-line tests.\n",

    "Analysis was made of disagreement expressions in dialogues recorded in a cooperative task experiment. A disagreement expression is defined as the latter utterance of consecutive utterances, which shows disagreement with the former. Subjects used two types of disagreement expressions: to the partner's utterance, and to their own. These were classified into three subtypes according to part of speech: conjunction, interjection, and content word. The role of disagreement expressions in cooperative tasks was examined. It was found that subjects used disagreement expressions suitable to the occasion to maintain good relation with their partners. It was concluded that using expressions that disagree with one's own previous utterance is an effective strategy for expressing an opinion for which one lacks adequate evidence and for eliciting utterances from one's partner.\n",

    "One way of investigating how tone languages and dialects differ with respect to their tonal phonetics is to use bilingual or bidialectal speakers. In this paper, the tones of a speaker who has native command of not just two, but three varieties of tone language are investigated acoustically and perceptually: Standard Thai, with 5 tones; Lao, with 7; and Nyo, with 4. This makes a maximum of 16 possible Linguistic-tonetically different tones. Mean fundamental frequency and duration values are presented for the allotones of the Lao, Standard Thai and Nyo tonemes on syllables with unstopped Rhymes. A perceptual experiment is described to determine how many of the 16 allotones are identifiable by Nyo tridialectal listeners. This approach enables us in a sense to see through the ears of both native speaker and native listener. The acoustic and perceptual data are used to demonstrate the existence of 10 linguistic-tonetically distinct tones. It is speculated that this might represent an upper limit for a multidialectal speaker.\n",

    "This paper examines one aspect of the phonetic mapping of tone onto segmental material. It asks whether prevocalic semivowels ([j- & w-]) can be said to constitute part of the material over which tonal F0 is distributed. The distribution of acoustical correlates of tone (F0, duration) is determined on syllables differing with respect to semivowels in the segmental structure in three of the contrasting contour tones (falling, convex and low rising) from the Chinese Wu dialect of Zhenhai. Four different syllable-structures are examined. It is concluded that (1) syllable-initial semivowels are not tonally relevant, and (2) semivowels behave differentially with respect to phonetic mapping depending on whether they are preceded by a syllable-initial consonant. Implications of the finding are explored for the phonological integration of semivowels into metrical syllable structure. The relevance of the finding is also pointed out for the measurement of tone (and intonation) acoustics in running speech.\n",

    "The work reported in this paper was the result of the need to label a large corpus of spontaneous, task-oriented dialogue with prosodic prominences. A computational model using only word duration, part of speech and a dictionary lookup of each word's canonical phonemic contents was trained against the results of a human coder marking prominence. Because word durations were normalised, it was possible to set a common threshold for all members of a form class above which the lexically stressed syllables were classed as prominent. The method used is presented and the relative importance of duration information, phonemic contents, syllabic context and part of speech information is explored. The automatic coder was validated against unseen material and achieved a 58% agreement with a human coder. Further investigation showed that three humans coders agreed no better with each other than each agreed with the computational model. Thus, although the automatic system did not conform very well to the performance of any one human coder, it conformed as well as another human coder might.\n",

In order to apply the waveform coding or hybrid coding techniques to synthesis by rule, we must be able to alter the pitches of synthetic speech. In this paper, we propose a new pitch alteration method that minimizes the spectrum distortion by using the behavior of cepstrum. This method splits the spectrum of speech signal into excitation spectrum and formant spectrum and transforms the excitation spectrum into cepstrum domain. The pitch of excitation cepstrum is altered by zero insertion or zero deletion and the pitch altered spectrum is reconstructed in spectrum domain. As a result of performance test, the average spectrum distortion was below 2.29% while that of conventional method is 2.47%.\n",

    "In VERBMOBIL we previously augmented the output of a word recognizer with prosodic information. Here we present a new approach of interleaving word recognition and prosodic processing. While we still use the output of a word recognizer to determine phrase boundaries, we do not wait until the end of the utterance before we start processing. Instead we intercept chunks of word hypotheses during the forward search of the recognizer. Neural networks and language models are used to predict phrase boundaries. Those boundary hypotheses, in turn, are used by the recognizer to cut the stream of incoming speech into syntactic-prosodic phrases. Thus, incremental processing is possible. We investigate which features are suited for incremental prosodic processing and compare them w.r.t. classification performance and efficiency. We show that with a set of features that can be computed efficiently classification results are achieved which are almost as good as those with the previously used computationally more expensive features.\n",

Varying the attentional parameter in the simulations varies in turn what counts as given and new in a text, and therefore, the intonational contours with which it is uttered. Currently, the system produces prosody in three different styles: child-like, adult expressive, and knowledgeable. This prosody also exhibits differences within each style -- no two simulations are alike.

    "The task of generating natural human-sounding prosody for text-to-speech (TTS) has historically been one of the most challenging problems that researchers and developers have had to face. TTS systems have in general become infamous for their \"robotic\" intonations. This paper describes an approach to this problem which endeavors to capture as much detail as possible from speech data, but in a way that avoids the \"black boxes\" typical of neural networks and some vector clustering algorithms. Unlike these latter methods, our approach may give feedback as to exactly what the crucial parameters are that determine the successful choice of pattern. Focusing on the notion of prosody templates, we confirmed that a representative F0 and duration pattern can be extracted based on stress pattern for a target proper noun which occurs in sentence-initial position.\n",

The connection rate, which means the strength of the relationship between two prosodic units, is defined. By repeatedly combining the two adjacent prosodic units where the rate is high, the tree structure is gradually generated. To determine the parameters objectively, we applied the principal component analysis to 32 dialogues from the Chiba Map Task Dialogue Corpus. Then we applied our method to one dialogue. The results suggested that the prosodic tree based on the first principal component was concerned with the information telling what the speaker wanted to do next and that the prosodic tree based on the second principal component represented the syntactic and grammatical structure.\n",

This model represented F0 contours of prosodic words to simultaneously detect and recognize prosodic word boundaries and accent types. This paper proposes a method where prosodic word F0 contours are modeled separately according to their accent types and presence/absence of succeeding pauses. An utterance is regarded as a sequence of prosodic words under a simple grammar. Each moraic F0 contour is represented by a pair of codes; the original shape code and the newly introduced delta code representing the degree of F0 change between the mora in question and its preceding mora. Compared with earlier results, the boundary detection rate improves from 87.7% to 91.5%. Accent type recognition rate reached 76.0% (type 1 accent discrimination).\n",

Based on tilt intonation theory (Taylor and Black 1994), two related but separate experiments were performed at speaker independent level, both using the Hidden Markov Model training technique. In the first experiment, a system is established so that rough boundary positions of major intonation events are detected. Subsequently the significant parameters are extracted from the products of the first experiment, which are directly used to train the final models for utterance type disambiguation. Results show that the intonation contour can be used as a significant meaning distinguisher in an automatic speech recognition system of Korean as well as in a natural human communication system.\n",

    "This paper presents: a multi-level concept to generate the speech rhythm in the Dresden TTS system for German (DreSS). The rhythm control includes the phrase, the syllabic and the phonemic level. The concept allows the alternative use of rule-based or statistical, but also data driven methods on these levels. To create the rules and to train a neural network, a new speech corpus from original speakers of the diphone-based inventories has been recorded. The corpus covers texts and single utterances and is subdivided into phrase, syllabic and phonemic databases. First results indicating that the rule-based and the train-based methods generate a comparable speech rhythm, if the databases are uniform. The stepwise duration control on several prosodic levels shows promise as a method of producing a flexible rhythm depending on the specific TTS application.\n",

    "This paper concerns with the study of EGG (electroglottalgram by laryngograph) model of ditoneme in Mandarin. The parameters for establishing models are fundamental frequency (F0), which is regarded as reference, speed quotient and open quotient, which are all extracted from the EGG signal by using the software EGG.exe, an option of CSL, Model 4300B, KAY. The result shows that speed quotient and open quotient have close relationships with the F0 in different ditonemes. In general, speed quotient and open quotient will decrease, when F0 increases in sustained vowels. But in the ditonemes, speed quotient and open quotient show different natures according to the position and environment. The conclusion is that EGG models of ditonemes are composed of the patterns of F0, speed quotient and open quotient in Mandarin.\n",

    "In this study predictors of speech rate that are sensitive to local and global rate changes, and relevant to different types of speakers, were examined. Two groups of subjects, normal and disfluent speakers (whose speech was clinically rated as \"slow\"), provided speech samples at normal and fast rates. Samples were segmented into interstress intervals (ISI) of varying length (i.e., varying number of syllables). The compressibility of components within ISIs of varying length provided information on local rate control strategies. The fast speech samples were useful for examining strategies used in global rate increases. Stressed vowels and intervowel intervals (IVI) showed similar trends in compression for both speakers, for local and global rate increases. We then investigated two measures of speech rate based on intervowel intervals: the ratio measure (IVI/ISI) and the average IVI. High correlation of average IVI with phone rate was found. Results of speech rate estimations are presented.\n",

    "One of the major findings of the recent linguistic research on Japanese is that the syllable plays a pivotal role in a variety of phonological and morphological phenomena in the mora-based prosodic system of this language. This paper attempts to reinforce this argument by proposing a significant generalization of Japanese accentuation in terms of `syllable weight', an idea that each syllable has a certain weight according to its phonological configuration. Specifically, this analysis reveals that Japanese accentuation is strikingly similar to that of Latin and many languages with a Latin-type accent system, e.g. English. Moreover, a sociolinguistic analysis of the accentual changes currently in progress demonstrates that Japanese accentuation is becoming increasingly similar to the Latin-type accent system, where the syllable plays a primary role.\n",

Korean tense or aspirated onset consonants raise f0 values of the following adjacent vowel, and when they are positioned on the first syllable onset of an accentual phrase, they continuously raise f0 values of the following non-adjacent vowels. This f0 raising after aspirated or tense consonants supports the previous claim that the microprosody in Korean is phonologized in phrase initial position. The results also confirms the previous claim regarding the location of the underlying 4 tones of the accentual phrase and the interpolation hypothesis.\n",

    "Pitch movements at the boundaries of sentence-medial and final phrases in Japanese can provide a cue to the speaker's intention. For example, the phrase /Nagano-de/ 'in Nagano' can be uttered with different rising and/or falling pitch movements on the the final mora /de/ to convey meanings such as clarification, incredulity, prominence in the discourse, insistence, etc. The identification of these movements is important not only for spoken language understanding systems, but also for natural-sounding speech synthesis. The current study examines F0 shape, height, and alignment characteristics of four distinct sentence-medial boundary rises. We compare these types with accented and focused unaccented words containing identical phonetic segments, and discuss a number of different possible phonological analyses of the pitch movements.\n",

    "This paper describes work in progress for recognizing a subset of ToBI intonation labels (H*, L+H*, L*, !H*, L+!H*, no accent). Initially, duration characteristics are used to classify syllables as accented or not. The accented syllables are then subclassified based on fundamental frequency, F0, values. Potential F0 intonation gestures are schematized by connected line segments within a window around a given syllable. The schematizations are found using spline-basis linear regression. The regression weights on F0 points are varied in order to discount segmental effects and F0 detection errors. Parameters based on the line segments are then used to perform the subclassification. This paper presents new results in recognizing L*, L+H*, and L+!H* accents. In addition, the models presented here perform comparably (80% overall, and 74% accent type recognition) to models which do not distinguish bitonal accents.\n",

The present study examines the influence of the segmental structure of an accented syllable on the timing of accent commands. It aims at developing refined alignment rules for speech synthesis. The corpus consists of 67 three-syllable words of German with word-accent on the second syllable produced by three male speakers three times. The words differ as to the structure of the second syllable. It was observed that onsets of accent commands can be most accurately predicted relative to the duration of the nuclear vowel, with variations depending on the type of consonant preceding the vowel. Accent command offsets are generally aligned with the offset of the syllable. The effectiveness of the refined timing rules was confirmed by an informal perception experiment.\n",

Research was conducted into mental state tendencies using tests that examined the perceptions of the subject's sensibility to the control of synthetic speech prosody. The results showed the relationships between prosodic control rules and non-verbal expressions. Duration control reflects information processing state in spoken dialogues. Sentence final pitch contour control reflects the reliability of the information. Pitch contour dynamic range control indicates the speaker's excitement. The pitch contour control from start to peak pitch contour indicates the speaker's requirement for attention. Furthermore, for the Multi-layered Speech/Sound Synthesis Control Language(MSCL) we construct prosodic feature control commands using prosodic control rules and semantic control commands using the relationships. MSCL realizes expressive synthetic speech.\n",

    "This paper describes a method of utilizing an ``F0 Reliability Field'' (FRF), which we have proposed in our previous work, for estimating prosodic commands on F0 contour generation model. This FRF is the time-frequency representation of F0 likelihood, and an advantage of FRF is that it is not necessary to consider F0 errors that occur during an automatic F0 determination. Therefore, it is thought that FRF can be a more useful feature for automatic prosody analyses than F0 contour, and our previous paper has reported the validity of FRF on the analysis of detecting prosodic boundaries in Japanese continuous speech. Moreover, in this paper, we have examined the validity on the prosodic command estimation of superpositional model. Experimental results show that the accuracy of command estimation with FRF is well and it is close to the accuracy of command estimation with ideal F0 contour that has no F0 error.\n",

Major elements which determine the emotion are pitch, tempo, and stress of speech. The last two elements correspond to duration and power of syllables, respectively. We choose five emotions to be tested; anger, surprise, sorrow, hate, and joy. To verify our analysis, we have implemented a speech synthesis module which can easily control prosodic parameters of output speech. Responses to the synthesized speech show that the parameters of anger, sorrow and hate are confirmed over 85 %.

Given the transcribed sentence with contextual information, the subjects were able to identify correctly the sentence type of 85% of 290 sentences. With information about the intonation contour types, they could correctly identify 90% of illocutionary acts. We find evidence that illocutionary acts can be signaled by specific contour types. These typical contours are realized in the sentence final boundary tone; a neutral or falling tone for assertion and request, a rising tone for question. An intonation contour is then identified using an algorithm that calculates the range and slope of the upper and lower bounds of unwarped segmental contour, and matches these against predefined contour templates. This automated intonation contour classification, nearly 90% of illocutionary acts could be correctly identified. (URL: http://www.brl.ntt.co.jp/info/dug/)\n",

    "In human dialog a wide variety of acknowledgments are used. One function of this seems to be indicating attention, interest, and involvement to the other speaker, and we believe this is an important factor in encouraging him and keeping up his interest. Thus, in this paper we focus on the problem of choosing appropriate acknowledgments at each point. Based on study of Japanese memory game dialogs, we propose an algorithm for choosing among acknowledgment responses, including `hai' (yes), `so' (right), and `un' (mm). The primary factors involved are aspects of the speaker's internal state, including confidence and liveliness, as inferred from the context and the speaker's prosody. Evaluation of naturalness and helpfulness of dialog generated by this algorithm suggests that judges prefer rule-based responses to randomly chosen responses, confirming our hypothesis that `sensitive' and subtle choice of response may improve helpfulness and naturalness of man-machine spoken language interaction.\n",

    "Prosodic cues (namely, fundamental frequency, energy and duration) provide important information for speech. For a tonal language such as Chinese, fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical role in characterizing tone as well, which is an essential phonemic feature. In this paper, we describe our work on duration and tone modeling for telephone-quality continuous Mandarin digits, and the application of these models to improve recognition. The duration modeling includes a speaking-rate normalization scheme. A novel F0 extraction algorithm is developed, and parameters based on orthonormal decomposition of the F0 contour are extracted for tone recognition. Context dependency is expressed by ``tri-tone'' models clustered into broad classes. A 20.0% error rate is achieved for four-tone classification. Over a baseline recognition performance of 5.1% word error rate, we achieve 31.4% error reduction with duration models, 23.5% error reduction with tone models, and 39.2% error reduction with duration and tone models combined.\n",

    "This brief study presents a set of acoustic correlates for a number of vocal emotions simulated by two actors. Five short sentences were used in the simulations. The emotions simulated were neutral, cold anger, hot anger, happiness, sadness, interest and elation. The seventy sentences were digitised and a number of acoustic analyses were carried out, which included a number of perturbation measures. The acoustic parameters investigated were: i) mean overall fundamental frequency (Hz); ii) overall mean energy (dB); iii) overall mean standard deviation of energy (dB); iv) mean overall jitter (%); and v) mean overall shimmer (dB). These acoustic parameters were used to profile the vocal emotions. Results showed that the actors displayed similarities in their acoustic profiles for some emotions like anger and sadness, for example. The results are presented and discussed in brief.\n",

    "This paper proposes a scheme of using F0 contours of vowel nuclei to discriminate Chinese lexical tones. The authors suggest that the F0 contour fragment of a vowel nucleus of a syllable contributes most to tone perception of the syllable. To correlate the F0 contour with the phonemic components of a syllable, a tone-based syllabic structure is also proposed. Tone recognition experiments on a speaker independent dissyllable words task proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. Better performance over approaches observing full syllabic F0 contours indicates that the proposed method is a more robust tone recognition method.\n",

    "A study was undertaken to determine differences between jitter and shimmer in voices of children with different syndromes. Voices of 60 children, both sexes, aged 7-12 years were analysed by EZ Voice Analysis Software (program for jitter and shimmer measuring). The main purpose of this paper has diagnostic background. Obtained results show, which acoustical indicators of pathological voice are in certain group of children, and in which shapes they appear. In that way, we try to find easiest way to explain acoustical characteristics of different voice pathologies as help in diagnostics. The results indicate that the children with stuttering and disartric symptoms have higher values almost in all applied variables than the average values of children from other groups. Children with Down syndrome and hearing losses exhibited the most disordered voice quality. Finally, the mixed group (stuttering with dysphonia) and group of children with dysphonia exhibited the least pathological characteristics of voice. Obtained results of Analysis of Variance have shown significant statistical differences in all applied variables among the groups.\n",

    "The Wu dialects of East-Central China are notorious for their tone sandhi, which is said to be the most complex in the world. This paper demonstrates that tonological complexity in Wu is not confined to tone sandhi, but is manifested also in citation tones. These show a both a large (7 - 8) number of contrasts and a very high percentage of contour and complex tones. Acoustic and auditory data are presented from an ongoing large-scale investigation into the tones and tone sandhi of the Wu dialects of Zhejiang province in East Central China. The citation tones from 4 sites (3 hitherto undescribed) in the little known Central Zhejiang area are described: Pujiang, Tonglu, Shengxian and Tiantai. Mean F0 and duration data are presented for the tones of these dialects. The data demonstrate a high degree of complexity, having no less than 25 Linguistic-tonetically different tones, including 3 different falling tones, and 4 different falling-level tones. The nature of the complexity of these forms is analysed.\n",

The fundamental frequency parameter was the most revealing, showing differences between anger and happiness according to the shape of the contour, and between \"cold\" anger and \"hot\" anger on F0 mean.

    "This paper looks into the question to what extent intonative structure determines word order variation in a particular type of syntactic structures in Dutch. Certain subordinate clauses in this language may contain verbal groups consisting of an auxiliary (aux) and a participle (part) that appear in sentence-final position. The order of these verbal elements is fundamentally free so that both aux+part and part+aux combinations occur. Analyses were based on a set of thirty spontaneous monologues, which contained 71 clauses with verbal endgroups, with the two orders about equally balanced. Distributional analyses revealed that prosodic features both inside the verbal group and in the immediately preceding and following contexts play a role in the choice for the two orders. First, a pitch accent on the participle mostly leads to a part+aux order. Second, an accent on the word immediately preceding the verbal endgroup under certain conditions favours an aux+part order, whereas a prosodic boundary after the endgroup favours a part+aux order. Results are discussed in terms of particular push principles, from the left and the right.\n",

Can the meaning difference between these pitch configurations be better described as a difference in information status or as a difference in attitude? Subjects were presented with the two contours on short sentences in specific contexts; the stimulus formed either the answer to a question (the focused information is new) or the completion of an enumeration (the focused information was already projected). In a pairwise comparison test subjects had to choose the contour best fitting the presented context. In a rating experiment subjects judged each combination of contour type and context on a number of semantic scales. Information status as well as attitude explain part of the results, indicating that both notions should be incorporated in the semantics of intonation.\n",

We find that, as a phonological marker, focus initiates an accentual phrase (AP), and tends to, but does not always, include the following words in the same AP. But regardless of whether the post-focus sequence is dephrased or not, there is a significant expansion of the focused peak compared to the peak on the following words, thus achieving the perceptual goal of focus: prominence of the focused word relative to the following items. As a phonetic marker, a focused AP has extra-strengthening on its left edge, and the sequence before and after focus tends to be shorter than that in a neutral sentence.\n",

    "Some people claim that contrastive accents are more emphatic than newness accents and have a different melodic shape. Others, however, maintain that contrastiveness can only be determined by looking at how accents are distributed in an utterance. In this paper it is argued that these two competing views can be reconciled by showing that they apply on different levels. To this end, accent patterns were obtained via a dialogue game (Dutch) in which two participants had to describe coloured figures in consecutive turns. Target descriptions (``blue square\") were collected in four contexts: no contrast (all new), contrast in the adjective, contrast in the noun, all contrast. A distributional analysis revealed that both all new and all contrast situations correspond with double accents, whereas single accents on the adjective or the noun are used when these are contrastive. Single contrastive accents on the adjective are acoustically different from newness accents in the same syntactic position. The former have the shape of a `nuclear' accent, whereas the newness accents on the adjective are `prenuclear'. Contrastive accents stand out as perceptually more prominent than newness accents. This difference in salience tends to disappear if the accented word is heard in isolation.\n",

    "This contribution describes a method for the automatic prosodic labeling of multi-lingual speech data. The automatic labeler assigns a boundary strength between 0 and 3 to each word boundary, and a word prominence between 0 and 9 to each word. The speech signal and its orthographic representation are first transformed to feature vectors comprising acoustic and linguistic features such as pitch, duration, energy, part-of-speech, punctuation, word frequency and stress. Next, the feature vectors are mapped to prosodic labels via a cascade of multi-layer perceptrons. Experiments on 6 different languages demonstrate that combining acoustic with linguistic features yields a better performance than obtainable on the basis of acoustic features alone. We also present experiments in which we assess the influence of the quality of the underlying phonetic segmentation and labeling on the prosodic labeling performance.\n",

    "The goal of the work presented here is to automatically predict the type of an utterance in spoken dialogue by using automatically extracted suprasegmental information. For this task we present and compare three stochastic algorithms: hidden Markov models, artificial neural nets, and classification and regression trees. These models are easily trainable, reasonably robust and fit into the probabilistic framework required for speech recognition. Utterance type detection is dependent on the assumption that different types of utterances have different suprasegmental characteristics. The categorisation of these utterance types is based on the theory of conversation games and consists of 12 move types (e.g. reply to a question, wh-question, acknowledgement). The system is speaker independent and is trained on spontaneous goal-directed dialogue collected from Canadian speakers. This utterance type detector is used in an automatic speech recognition system to reduce word error rate.\n",

    "Singapore English and British English have been claimed to differ in lexical stress placement. Examples cited in the literature involve polysyllabic words such as 'hopelessly' and compounds such as 'blackboard'. Such words are stressed word-initially in BE, but are said to be stressed word-finally in SE. Two observations lead us to explore the claim that SE and BE differ in lexical stress placement. Firstly, observations about stress differences between SE and BE are based solely on auditory impressions by British English listeners. Acoustic evidence is not available. Secondly, the auditory evidence comes from realisations of test words in citation form, i.e. in nuclear, phrase-final position. If Singapore English has more phrase-final lengthening than British English, then this may account for the suggested differences in lexical stress placement. In the present paper, we investigate the acoustic evidence for the suggested cross-varietal difference.\n",

    "In this paper we present an integrated approach for recognizing both the word sequence and the syntactic-prosodic structure of a spontaneous utterance. We take into account the fact that a spontaneous utterance is not merely an unstructured sequence of words by incorporating phrase boundary information into the language model and by providing HMMs to model boundaries. This allows for a distinction between word transitions across phrase boundaries and transitions within a phrase. During recognition, the syntactic-prosodic structure of the utterance is determined implicitly. Without any increase in computational effort, this leads to a 4% reduction of word error rate, and, at the same time, syntactic-prosodic boundary labels are provided for subsequent processing. The boundaries are recognized with a precision and recall rate of about 75% each. They can be used to reduce drastically the computational effort for parsing spontaneous utterances. We also present a system architecture to incorporate additional prosodic information.\n",

    "Phrase accents, one of the three tonal categories assumed by much recent research on intonation, are expected to associate with a prosodic boundary (e.g. the end of the utterance) but not to phonetically align with a specific tone-bearing unit (TBU), such as a stressed syllable. This paper presents experimental evidence on the intonation of Cypriot Greek polar questions suggesting that phrase accents prefer to associate with specific TBUs. Concretely, it is shown that in Cypriot Greek polar question intonation, autosegmentally described as L* H L%, the H phrase accent does not align with the final stressed vowel as in Standard Greek, but instead it aligns approximately 30ms from the onset of either the penultimate or the final vowel of the utterance. The data provide evidence that phrase accents, like other tonal categories, exhibit stable phonetic alignment and support Ladd, Arvaniti and Mennen's (1997) typology of stress-seeking and non-stress-seeking phrase accents.\n",

    "This paper presents a two-step model for the symbolic coding and generation of intonation. First, the F0 curve is reduced to a series of pitch target points that capture the macroprosodic information of the utterance. Target points are then converted into a sequence of labels. Generation is achieved through the reverse steps. The model is language independent and requires no prior training on the data. We discuss the influence of the number of categories on the precision of fit, and show, by an evaluation on a large multilingual corpus (4 hours 20 minutes of speech, 50 speakers, 5 languages) that a model composed of three ascending and three descending categories, plus a category for small or null movements enables a regeneration of ca. 99% of points at less than 2 ST than the original. Given that the model is capable of various improvements, it seems a good candidate for practical applications.\n",

    "Parameter tying is often used in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems to balance the model resolution and generalizability. However, one consequence of tying is that the differences among tied constructs are ignored. Parameter tying can be alternatively viewed as reciprocal data sharing in that a tied construct uses data associated with all others in its tied-class. To capture the fine difference among tied constructs, we propose to use nonreciprocal data sharing (NRDS) when estimating HMM parameters. In particular, when estimating Gaussian parameters for a HMM state, contributions from other acoustically similar HMM states will be weighted, thus allowing different statistics to govern different states. Data sharing weights are optimized using cross-validation. It can be shown that the objective function for cross-validation is a sum of rational functions and can be efficiently optimized by the growth-transform. Our results on Switchboard show that NRDS reduces the word error rate (WER) significantly compared with a state-of-art baseline system using HMM state-tying.\n",

Conditional mutual information is used to determine both relevance and discriminability. Extended Gaussian-mixture HMMs and new EM update equations are introduced. In an isolated word speech database, results show an average 34% word error improvement over an HMM with the same number of states, and a 15% improvement over an HMM with a comparable number of parameters.\n",

The new algorithm produces 30% fewer segments, and improves TIMIT phonetic recognition performance by 2.4% over an acoustic segmentation baseline.

    "In this paper, we present a new technique for statistical modeling of speech segments based on Markov random fields. Classical and multi-stream HMMs are particular cases of this more general family of models. However, the Random Field Model (RFM) proposed here can be seen as an extension of the multi-band HMM in which interactions between the frequency bands have been added. In a first experiment, samples are drawn from different models and compared to real observations. This experiment shows that the RFM is able to produce realistic samples but a single HMM still performs better. Isolated word recognition experiments stress the fact that more work must be done on the RFM in order to reach the performances of classical hidden Markov modeling techniques. For the moment, the RFM parameters are estimated using a heuristic. We believe that a real maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithm should improve the results. The main advantage of this new model is that it can easily be extended since a model is defined by some local interactions and the Gibbs potential functions associated to those interactions.\n",

    "Current state-of-the-art statistical speech recognition systems use hidden Markov models (HMM) for modeling the speech signal. However, it is well known that HMM's do not exploit the time-dependence in the speech process, since they are limited by the assumption of conditional independence of observations given the state sequence. Alternative techniques, such as segment modeling approaches, can effectively exploit time-dependencies in the acoustic signal by discarding the observation independence assumption. However, losing the basic HMM structure is often a high computational price to pay for improved acoustic models. In this paper, we introduce the parallel path HMM that exploits the time-dependence in speech via parametric trajectory models while maintaining the HMM framework. We present preliminary results on Switchboard, a large vocabulary conversational speech recognition task, demonstrating both improved modeling and potential for improved recognition performance.\n",

This time, to improve a mass of these templates to a smarter model, we introduced a statistical method into modeling. The structure of SPSM connects 5 distributions of Gaussian N-mixture density in series. By the experiment of closed Japanese spoken word recognition, using VCV balanced 4920 words spoken by 10 male adults including 34430 phonemes in total, the rate of phoneme recognition using SPSM was up to 90.23 % compared with the rate using phoneme templates, 80.39 %.\n",

    "Many HMM-based recognition systems use mixtures of diagonal covariance gaussians to model the observation density functions in the states. These mixtures are however only approximations of the real distributions. One of the approximations is the assumption that the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrices of the gaussians are close to zero (diagonal covariance). To that end, most recognition systems have some kind of parameter decorrelation near the end of the preprocessing, e.g. the inverse cosine transform used with cepstral transformations. These transforms are however not optimal if it comes to decorrelating features on the gaussian level. This paper presents an optimal solution in a least-square sense to the decorrelation problem. It also demonstrates the link between the recently published maximum likelihood modelling for semi-tied covariance matrices and the presented least-squares optimisation. Evaluation on a large vocabulary recognition task shows a 10% relative improvement.\n",

Our approach aims at bringing todays mostly task dependent systems closer to the aspired goal of domain independence. To achieve this, we rely on the ACID/HNN framework, a hierarchical connectionist modeling paradigm which allows to dynamically adapt a tree structured modeling hierarchy to differing specificity of phonetic context in new domains. Experimental validation of the proposed approach has been carried out by adapting size and structure of ACID/HNN based acoustic models trained on Switchboard to two quite different, unseen domains, Wall Street Journal and an English Spontaneous Scheduling Task. In both cases, our approach yields considerably downsized acoustic models with performance improvements of up to 18% over the unadapted baseline models.\n",

    "Many automatic speech recognition telephony applications involve recognition of input containing some type of numbers. Traditionally, this has been achieved by using isolated or connected digit recognizers. However, as speech recognition finds a wider range of applications, it is often infeasible to impose restrictions on speaker behavior. This paper studies two model topologies for natural number recognition which use minimum classification error (MCE) trained inter-word context dependent acoustic models. One model topology uses triphone context units while another is of the head-body-tail (HBT) type. The performance of the models is evaluated on three natural number applications involving recognition of dates, time of day, and dollar amounts. Experimental results show that context dependent models reduce string error rates by as much as 50% over baseline context independent whole-word models. String accuracies of about 93% are obtained on these tasks while at the same time allowing users flexibility in speaking styles.\n",

There is much to explore about the \"quality\" of states in an HMM and the inter-relationships between inter-state and intra-state Gaussians used to model speech. Of particular interest is the variable discriminating power of the individual states. The fundamental concept addressed in this paper is to investigate means of exploiting such dependencies through model topology optimization based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle.\n",

    "It is well-known that HMMs only of the basic structure cannot capture the correlations among successive frames adequately. In our previous work, to solve this problem, segmental unit HMMs were introduced and their effectiveness was shown. And the integration of delta- cepstrum and delta-delta- cepstrum into the segmental unit HMMs was also found to improve the recognition performance in the work. In this paper, we investigated further refinements of the models by using a mixture of PDFs and/or context dependency, where, for a given syllable, only a preceding vowel was treated as the context information. Recognition experiments showed that the accuracy rate was improved by 23 %, which clearly indicates the effectiveness of the refinements examined in this paper. The proposed syllable-based HMM outperformed a triphone model.\n",

The Gaussian tree structure is built from successive Gaussian density merging. Each node of the tree is associated with a Gaussian density, and the actual HMM densities are associated to the leaves. We propose then a criterion to obtain good recognition performances with this Gaussian tree structure. This structure is evaluated with a continuous speech recognition system on a telephone database.

    "The goal of this work is to model phone-like units automatically from spoken word samples without using any transcriptions except for the lexical identification of the words. In order to implement this task, we have proposed the \"piecewise linear segment lattice (PLSL)\" model for phoneme representation. The structure of this model is a lattice of segments, each of which is represented as regression coefficients of feature vectors within the segment. In order to organize phone models, operations including division, concatenation, blocking and clustering are applied to the models. This paper mainly report on blocking and clustering. Experimental results for isolated word recognition task is that the recognition rate is significantly improved by blocking the segments and by clustering the segments within a block. We get sufficient performance for the task with the models consist of at most 128 clusters of segment patterns.\n",

    "Training of continuous density hidden Markov models(CDHMMs) is usually time-consuming and tedious due to the large number of model parameters involved. Recently we proposed a new derivative of CDHMM, the subspace distribution clustering hidden Markov model(SDCHMM) which tie CDHMMs at the finer level of subspace distributions, resulting in many fewer model parameters. An SDCHMM training algorithm is also devised to train SDCHMMs directly from speech data without intermediate CDHMMs. On the ATIS task, speaker-independent context-independent(CI) SDCHMMs can be trained with as little as 8 minutes of speech with no loss in recognition accuracy --- a 25-fold reduction when compared with their CDHMM counterparts. In this paper, we extend our novel SDCHMM training to context-dependent(CD) modeling with the assumption of various prior knowledge. Despite the 30-fold increase of model parameters in the CD ATIS CDHMMs, their equivalent CD SDCHMMs can still be estimated with a few minutes of ATIS data.\n",

Four different mix-up criteria are proposed to decide how to increase the size of the states. These criteria, derived from Maximum Likelihood scores, are focused to increase the discrimination between states obtaining different number of gaussians per state. We compare these proposed methods with the common approach where the number of density functions used in every state is equal and pre-fixed by the designer. Experimental results demonstrate that performance can be maintained while reducing the total number of density functions by 17% (from 2046 down to 1705).

    "This paper describes a novel method that models the correlation between acoustic observations in contiguous speech segments. The basic idea behind the method is that acoustic observations are conditioned not only on the phonetic context but also on the preceding acoustic segment observation. The correlation between consecutive acoustic observations is modeled by polynomial mean trajectory segment models. This method is an extension of conventional segment modeling approaches in that it not only describes the correlation of acoustic observations inside segments but also between contiguous segments. It is also a generalization of phonetic context (e.g., triphone) modeling approaches because it can model acoustic context and phonetic context at the same time. In a speaker-independent phoneme classification test, using the proposed method resulted in a 7-9% reduction in error rate as compared to the traditional triphone segmental model system and a 31% reduction as compared to a similar triphone HMM system.\n",

    "An acoustic model is a simplified mathematical representation of acoustic-phonetic information. The simplifying assumptions inherent to each model entail that it may only be capable of capturing a certain aspect of the available information. An effective combination of different types of model should therefore permit a combined model that can utilize all the information captured by the individual models. This paper reports some preliminary research in combining certain types of acoustic model for speech recognition. In particular, we designed and implemented a single HMM framework, which combines a segment-based modeling technique with the standard HMM technique. The recognition experiments, based on a speaker-independent E-set database, have shown that the combined model has the potential of producing a significantly higher performance than the individual models considered in isolation.\n",

    "Although having revealed to be a very powerful tool in acoustic modelling, discriminative training presents a major drawback: the lack of a formulation guaranteeing convergence in no matter which initial conditions, such as the Baum-Welch algorithm in maximum likelihood training. For this reason, a gradient descent search is usually used in this kind of problem. Unfortunately, standard gradient descent algorithms rely heavily on the election of the learning rates. This dependence is specially cumbersome because it represents that, at each run of the discriminative training procedure, a search should be carried out over the parameters ruling the algorithm. In this paper we describe an adaptive procedure for determining the optimal value of the step size at each iteration. While the calculus and memory overhead of the algorithm is negligible, results show less dependence on the initial learning rate than standard gradient descent and, using the same idea in order to apply self-scaling, it clearly outperforms it.\n",

    "Discriminative training is a powerful tool in acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition. Its strength is based on the direct minimisation of the number of errors committed by the system at recognition time. This is usually accomplished by defining an auxiliary function that characterises the behaviour of the system, and adjusting the parameters of the system in a way that this function is minimised. The main drawback of this approach is that a task specific training database is needed. In this paper an alternative procedure is proposed: task adaptation using task independent databases. It consists in the combination of acoustic information -estimated using a general purpose training database-, and linguistic information -taken from the definition of the task-. In the experiments carried out, this technique has led to great improvement in the recognition of two different tasks: clean speech digit strings in English and dates in Spanish over the telephone wire.\n",

This paper shows how equivalence with an extended meta-HMM solves the problem and how reestimation formulas have to be applied to guarantee equivalence between the multistream model and the meta-HMM.

Regularization is done by augmenting the EM training method by a penalty term that favors simple  and smooth HMM systems. The penalty term is constructed as a mixture model of negative exponential distributions that is assumed to generate the  state dependent emission probabilities of the HMMs. This new method is the successful transfer of a well known regularization approach in neural networks to the HMM domain and can be interpreted as a generalization of traditional state-tying for HMM systems. The effect of regularization is demonstrated for continuous speech recognition tasks by improving overfitted triphone models and by speaker adaptation with limited training data.\n",

Therefore, three different mapping approaches, based on either phonetic knowledge and/or acoustical distance measures have been tested. The performance of this model combination method and several variations of it has been measured and compared with standard MLLR adaptation. For the baseline model combination small improvements of recognition accuracy compared to the results based on applying MLLR were obtained. Furthermore, slight improvements were found when using an a-priori approach, where the models were combined with predefined weights before applying any of the adaptation techniques.\n",

The proposed duration modeling technique uses a cumulative duration probability. The cumulative duration probability also can be used to obtain the duration bounds for the bounded duration modeling. One of the advantages of proposed technique is that the cumulative duration probability can be applied directly to the Viterbi decoding procedure without additional postprocessing. Therefore, it rules the state and word transition at each frame. To alleviate the problems due to fast or slow speech, a modification to the bounded duration modeling which accounts for speaking rate is described. The experimental results on Korean connected digit recognition show the effectiveness of the proposed duration modeling scheme and the speaking rate compensation technique.\n",

    "This paper describes the application of Bayesian networks to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Bayesian networks enable the construction of probabilistic models in which an arbitrary set of variables can be associated with each speech frame in order to explicitly model factors such as acoustic context, speaking rate, or articulator positions. Once the basic inference machinery is in place, a wide variety of models can be expressed and tested. We have implemented a Bayesian network system for isolated word recognition, and present experimental results on the PhoneBook database. These results indicate that performance improves when the observations are conditioned on an auxiliary variable modeling acoustic/articulatory context. The use of multivalued and multiple context variables further improves recognition accuracy.\n",

    "The concept of splitting the entire frequency domain into sub-bands and processing the spectra in these bands independently in between every consecutive recombination stage to generate a final score has recently been proposed for speech recognition. Some of the aspects of this technique have also been studied for the task of speaker recognition. A remaining critical problem in this approach, however, is the determination of appropriate recombination weights. This paper presents a new method for generating these weights for sub-band based speaker verification. The approach is based on the use of background speaker models and aims to reduce the effect of any mismatch between the band-limited segments of the test utterance and the corresponding sections in the target speaker model. The paper also discusses a problem generally associated with the sub-band cepstral features and outlines a possible solution.\n",

    "This paper describes a methodology for analysing the dynamic encoding of identity and dialect in prosodic parameters. Properties of the well-known DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) path of best match allow the separation of dynamic from static properties of acoustic parameters. A database of 19 speakers of Australian English was recorded and F0, energy, zero crossing rate and voicing contours extracted. Discriminant analysis figures measured identity encoding, while correlation rates measured dialect. Dynamic encoding levels were found to be significantly higher than static for both speaker characteristics (identity: 75% versus 55%; dialect: 0.58 versus 0.45).Normalisation of acoustic parameters into the range 0--1, eliminating all static information, reduced encoding levels to 70% (identity) and 0.52 (dialect) showing the robustness of dynamic encoding. Contrasting DTW warp path properties with the DTW distance showed the warp path a significantly better extractor of encoded information (72% versus 54% for identity; 0.45 versus 0.30 for dialect).\n",

    "A well known problem in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is robustness against the variability of speech between speakers. There are several ways to normalise different speakers; one of them is to deal with the problem of regional variation. In this paper we discuss the problem of whether moderate regional variants of German influence the ASR process and whether there is a way to improve performance through knowledge of the regional origin of the unknown speaker. The basic idea is to cluster test speakers into distinct dialectal regions and derive observations about the typical pronunciation within these regions from a classified training set. In a cheating experiment where the origin of the test speakers is known we verify whether the use of the dialect-specific pronunciation forms will improve the overall performance. It turns out that simply using dialect-specific pronunciation does not significantly improve word accuracy on the VERBMOBIL task.\n",

Results demonstrate that the linguistic theory is reflected in real speech data and its application improves accent identification. The work discussed here combines and applies previous research in language identification based on phonemic features with the analysis of the structure and function of the English language. Working with phonemically handlabelled data in three accented speaker groups of Australian English (Vietnamese, Lebanese, and native speakers), we show that accents of foreign speakers can be predicted and manifest themselves differently as a function of their position within the syllable. When applying this knowledge, English vs. Vietnamese accent identification improves from 86% to 93% (English vs. Lebanese improves from 78% to 84%). The described algorithm is also successfully applied to automatically aligned phonemes.\n",

    "This study explored the attributes of languages to which listeners attend, using magnitude estimation and multidimensional scaling techniques. In magnitude estimation. listeners assign any numerical value to a set of stimuli. In response to the question: How similar is this language to English'? fifty college students assigned numerical values to spoken samples of foreign languages. The languages represented Europe, Asia and Africa. Differences between the mean ratings for each language and English were used to construct a proximity matrix which was submitted to MDS analysis. The optimum solution employed three dimensions. The first dimension was interpreted as \"familiarity,\" the second as \"speaker affect,\" and the third as \"prosodic pattern.\" The MDS maps suggest that listeners were using English as a standard of comparison to the acoustic-phonetic properties of other languages. The maps resulted from the relationship between each language and the standard. and speaker and language characteristics which listeners found salient.\n",

Our results show that generally the most affected parts of speech are the auxiliary verbs. The regions with the highest deviation rates of standard German are Switzerland and Austria, and the regions in southern Germany. We can only add the vague answer to the question, whether the semantically topic of a story may have an influence upon the deviation of the standard language, that our results show a striking less frequency of pronunciation variants, when people speak about their jobs.\n",

    "Recently, some large-scale text dependent speaker verification systems have been tested. They show that less than 1% Equal Error Rate can be obtained on a test set score distribution. So far, the majority of impostor tests are performed using speakers who don't really try to fool the system. This can be explained by the lack of databases recorded for this purpose, and the difficulty for a normal speaker to transform his voice characteristics. Nevertheless, actual automatic analysis/synthesis techniques, such as Harmonic plus Noise Model (H+N), allows very good speech/speaker transformations. Thus, it becomes possible to transform the voice of a speaker in the voice of another speaker in order to make voluntary impostures. This paper evaluates these kind of intrusive impostures and proposes a new speech pre-processing method, based on harmonic subtraction, making speaker verification less insensitive to these spectral transformations. A state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model is used as reference system to assess the transformation results. The speech is parameterised by LPCC coefficients. The results are obtained on a database of telephone speech quality. The speaker verification system works in text dependent mode.\n",

Two techniques have been investigated to classify British- and American-accented speech: an acoustic approach, in which we analyse the pattern of usage of the distributions in the recogniser by a speaker to decide on his most probable accent, and a high-level approach in which we use a phonotactic model for classification of the accent.

In this paper we define two basic verification measurements, a qualifier-based measurement and a competition-based measurement, and examine score normalisation approaches using these two measurements. This leads to some useful theoretical differentiation between cohort model and world model approaches used for HMM score normalisation. We adopted a world model method for score normalisation in the system. The adaptive variance flooring technique is also implemented in the system.

Even better speaker identification results than using mel-cepstrum were observed on the TIMIT database, especially when white noise was added. In this paper, the hybridization of both linear prediction and filter-bank spectral analysis using either cepstral transformation or the alternative frequency filtering is explored for speaker verification.

Perceptual experiments were conducted, where subjects were asked to evaluate sentence utterances recorded from a variety of male speakers in terms of 25 epithets which were derived in another experiment [1] to be indicative of voice quality relevant to talker individuality. The evaluation scores were subjected to a statistical clustering analysis. The analysis resulted in that the 25 epithets could be grouped into either eight categories for male or seven for female subjects. These categories were basically the same as those obtained in the previous experiment [1] where subjects were required to evaluate their own voice with the same set of 25 epithets. Agreement between the results from the two experiments guarantees reliability of the core epithet categories to represent voice quality associated with talker individuality.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a procedure for training a pronunciation network with criteria consistent with the optimality objectives for speech recognition systems. In particular, we describe a framework for using maximum likelihood(ML) and minimum classification error(MCE) criteria for pronunciation network optimization. The ML criterion is used to obtain an optimal structure for the pronunciation network based on statistically-derived phonological rules. Discrimination among different pronunciation networks is achieved by weighting of the pronunciation networks, optimized by applying the MCE criterion. Experiment results demonstrate improvements in speech recognition accuracy after applying statistically derived phonological rules. It is shown that the impact of the pronunciation network weighting on the recognition performance is determined by the size of the recognition vocabulary.\n",

    "ABSTRACT Traditional dialect maps are based on data from carefully selected informants which usually results in clear-cut dialect borders, isoglosses, with one dialect characteristic present on one side of the isogloss and absent on the other. We illustrate some of the problems and pitfalls connected with using dialect maps for ASR by comparing results from traditional dialect research with investigations of the Norwegian part of the European SpeechDat database, centred on the two main types of /r/ pronunciation. Our analysis shows that traditional dialect maps and surveys may be of limited use in ASR. To what extent the Norwegian findings have parallels in other countries will depend on two main factors, dialect allegiance vs. a national standard pronunciation and the extent to which the population is sedentary or mobile. Results from traditional dialect research may therefore be more useful in ASR of other languages than Norwegian.\n",

    "The acoustic aspects that differentiate voices are difficult to separate from signal traits that reflect the identity of the sounds. There are two sources of variation among speakers: (1) differences in vocal cords and vocal tract shape, and (2) differences in speaking style. The latter includes variations in both target vocal tract positions for phonemes and dynamic aspects of speech, such as speaking rate. However, most parameters and features are in the former. In this paper, we propose the use of a prosodic feature that represents micro prosody of utterances. The robustness of the prosodic feature on noise environment becomes clear. Also we propose a combined model. The combined model uses both the spectral feature and the prosodic feature. In our experiments, this model provides robust speaker recognition in noise environments.\n",

    "This paper describes the use of speech fundamental frequency (F0) for speaker verification. Both Chinese and English have been included in this study, with Chinese representing a tonal language and English representing a non-tonal language. A HMM-based speaker verification system has been developed, using features based on cepstral coefficients and the F0 contour. Four different techniques have been investigated in our experiments on the YOHO database and a Chinese speech database similar to YOHO. It has been found that the pitch information results in a reduction of the equal error rates by 40.5% and 33.9% in Cantonese and English, respectively, suggesting that the pitch information is important for speaker verification and that it is more important for tonal languages. We have also found that the pitch information is even more effective when it is represented in the log domain, resulting in an ERR of 2.28% for Cantonese. This ERR corresponds to a reduction of the ERR by 54%.\n",

In previous work on language recognition, building anti-models to normalise the scores from acoustic phone models for target languages, has been shown to reduce the Equal Error Rate (EER) by a third.

    "In the speaker recognition, when the cepstral coefficients are calculated from the LPC analysis parameters, the LPC residual and pitch are usually ignored. This paper describes an approach to integrate the pitch and LPC-residual with the LPC-cepstrum in a Gaussian Mixture Model based speaker recognition system. The pitch and LPC-residual are represented as a logarithm of the F0 and as a MFCC vector respectively. The second task of this research is to verify whether the correlation between the different information sources is useful for the speaker recognition task. The results showed that adding the pitch gives significant improvement only when the correlation between the pitch and cepstral coefficients is used. Adding only LPC-residual also gives significant improvement, but using the correlation with the cepstral coefficients does not have big effect. The best achieved results are 98.5% speaker identification rate and 0.21% speaker verification equal error rate compared to 97.0% and 1.07% of the baseline system, respectively.\n",

In contrast to other discriminative algorithms, the objective function is optimized using a modified Expectation- Maximization (EM) algorithm which greatly simplifies the training procedure. The evaluation experiments using both clean and telephone speech showed improvement of the recognition rates compared to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) trained speaker models, especially when the mismatch between the training and testing conditions is significant.\n",

For each language, lexical information is introduced by augmenting the phone vocabulary with the N most frequent words in the training data. Combined phone and word bigram models are used to provide linguistic constraints during acoustic decoding. Experiments were carried out on a 4-language telephone speech corpus. Using lexical information achieves a relative error reduction of about 20% on spontaneous and read speech compared to the reference phone-based system. Identification rates of 92%, 96% and 99% are achieved for spontaneous, read and task-specific speech segments respectively, with prior speech detection.\n",

    "In speaker recognition systems based on VQ, normally each speaker is assigned a codebook, and the classification is done by means of the a distortion distance of the utterance computed by means of each codebook. In [1] we proposed a system which instead of having a codebook for each speaker, had only one codebook for all the speakers, and for each speaker one histogram. This histogram was the occupancy rate of each codeword for a given speaker. This means that the information of the histogram of a given speaker is the probability that the speaker utters the information related to the codeword. So we approximated the pdf of each speaker by the normalized histogram. In this paper we present an exhaustive study of different measures for comparing histograms: Kullbach-Leiber, log-difference of each probability, geometrical distance, and the Euclidean distance. We have done also an exhaustive study of the properties of the system for each distance in the presence of noise (white and colored), and for different parameterizations: LPC, MFCC, LPC-Cepstrum-OSA (One sided autocorrelation sequence), LCP-Cepstrum. (Cepstrum with/without liftering). As the combination of experiments was high, the conclusions were drawn after an analysis of variance (ANOVA), and T-tests. Thus the conclusions, with significance levels, can be drawn about the differences and interactions between kind of. distance, parameterization, kind of noise and level of noise.\n",

This preliminary study describes an investigation of the differences in L1 dialect prosodic transfer to English between the speakers of the Fukushima dialect (an accentless dialect) and the Tokyo dialect (an accent dialect) in declarative sentences and yes-no questions. A two-way communicative task was selected to induce natural utterances. The fundamental frequency at each point of twenty equally-spaced points of observation of three female voices from each dialect group was measured. The major finding is there do appear to be dialectal differences in L1 transfer of prosody.

    "This paper is concerned about speaker verification (SV) using the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). In the SPRT input samples are usually assumed to be i.i.d. samples from a probability density function because an on-line probability computation is required. Feature vectors used in speech processing obviously do not satisfy the assumption and therefore the correlation between successive feature vectors has not been considered in conventional SV using the SPRT. The correlation can be modeled by the hidden Markov model (HMM) but unfortunately the HMM can not be directly applied to the SPRT because of statistical dependence of input samples. This paper proposes a method of HMM probability computation using the mean field approximation to resolve this problem, where the probability of whole input samples is nominally represented as the product of probability of each sample as if input samples were independent each other.\n",

    "Regarding speaker identity in forensic conditions, several factors of variability must be taken into account, as peculiar intra-speaker variability, forced intra-speaker variability or channel-dependent external influences. Using 'AHUMADA' large speech database in Spanish, containing several recording sessions and channels, and including different tasks for 100 male speakers, automatic speaker verification experiments have been accomplished. Due to the inherent non-cooperative nature of speakers in forensic applications, only text-independent recognizers are used. In this sense, a GMM-based verification system is being used in order to obtain quantitative results. Maximum likelihood estimation of the models is performed, and LPC-cepstra, delta- and delta-delta-LPCC, are used at the parameterization stage. With this baseline verification system, we intend to determine how some variability sources included in 'AHUMADA' affect speaker identification. Results including speaking rate influence, single- and multi-session training, cross-channel testing, and kind of speech (read vs. spontaneous) are presented when likelihood-domain normalization is applied.\n",

First an automatic procedure is presented to split speech material into different categories according to the speaking rate. Then the problem of sparse data available for the estimation of HMMs for fast speech is discussed. A comparison of different methods to overcome this problem follows. The main emphasis here is set on robust reestimation techniques like maximum aposteriori estimation (MAP) as well as on methods to reduce the variability of the speech signal and therefore to be able to reduce the number of HMM parameters. Vocaltract length normalization (VTLN) is chosen for that purpose. Finally a comparison of various combinations of the methods discussed is presented basing on word error rates for fast speech. The best method (MAPVTLN) results in a decrease of the error rate of 10% relative to the baseline system.\n",

    "In this paper we present a novel technique for combining a Speaker Verification System with an Utterance Verification System in a Speaker Authentication system over the telephone. Speaker Verification consists in accepting or rejecting the claimed identity of a speaker by processing samples of his/her voice. Usually, these systems are based on HMM's that try to represent the characteristics of the talkers' vocal tracts. Utterance Verification systems make use of a set of speaker-independent speech models to recognize a certain utterance and decide whether a speaker has uttered it or not. If the utterances consist of passwords, this can be used for identity verification purposes. Up to now, both techniques have been used separately. This paper is focused on the problem of how to combine these two sources of information. A new architecture is presented to join an utterance verification system and a speaker verification system in order to improve the performance in a text-dependent speaker verification task.\n",

Provided it was well tuned, we found that the output level fused system always outperformed the input level fused system under all experimental conditions.\n",

    "Since we cannot exclude that speech recognizers fail sometimes, it is important to examine how users react to recognition errors. In correction situations, speaking style becomes more accentuated to disambiguate the original mistake. We examine the effect of speaking style in such situations on speech recognition performance. Our results indicate that hyperarticulated effects occur in correction situations and decrease word accuracy significantly.\n",

    "This paper presents a neural network inspired approach to speaker recognition using speaker models constructed from full data sets. A similarity measure between data sets is used for text-independent speaker identification and verification. In order to reduce the computational effort in calculating the similarity measure, a fuzzy Vector Quantisation procedure is applied. This method has previously been successfully applied to a database of 108 Australian English speakers. The purpose of this paper is to apply this method to a larger benchmark database of 630 speakers (TIMIT Database). Using the full 630-speaker database, an accuracy of 98.2% (one test sentence) and 99.7% (two test sentences) was achieved for text-independent speaker identification. On a 462-speaker subset of the database a 98.5% successful acceptance and 96.9% successful rejection rate for text-independent speaker verification was achieved.\n",

    "In this paper we exploit linguistic knowledge to aid in automatic dialect identification in Spanish. Segments of extemporaneous Cuban and Peruvian Spanish dialect data from the Miami Corpus were analyzed and 49 linguistic features that occur with different rates in each of the two dialects identified and hand-labelled. We evaluate the expected performance of the dialect detection system based on a theoretical model and compute the systems' performance. Using a Gaussian classifier we show that a subset of the 49 originally-identified features obtains nearly perfect performance for discriminating between the two dialects. We compare these results with those from an automatic recognition system (PRLM-P). We then test this system in the limited domain of read digits from 0 through 10 using an orthographic transcription and hand-marked data for phone extraction and alignment. Initial experiments on phone-level segments show that phone duration and energy computations prove discriminatory for dialect discrimination.\n",

Two possible ways of establishing the global speaker model, one of which can meet the real-time requirement, are also suggested and discussed.

    "Experiments have been carried out to assess the feasibility of detecting target speaker segments in multi-speaker broadcast databases, The experimental database consists of NBC Nightly News broadcasts. The target speaker is the news anchor, Tom Brokaw. Gaussian mixture models are constructed from labelled training data for the target speaker as well as background models for other speakers,, commercials, and music. Four labelled 30-min. broadcasts are used ffor testing. Mel-frequency cepstral features, augmented by delta cepstral features, are calculated over 20 msec. windows shifted every 10 msecs. through a broadcast. Likelihood ratio scores are calculated for each test frame averaged over blocks of frames with a specified duration. The block scores are input to a detection routine which returns estimates of target segment boundaries. The range of best results obtained over the test broadcasts is 82% to 100% detection of target segments with segment frame accuracy ranging from 86% to 95%. 0 to 2 false alarm segments are detected over each 30 min. broadcast.\n",

    "Speaker recognition is usually accomplished by building a set of models from speech of a known speaker, training data, and subsequently using a pattern matching algorithm to score the speech from an unknown speaker, test data. In this paper we discard the notion of train and test data in speaker recognition and introduce the multilateral scoring technique. This technique comprises building speaker models on material for the known speaker and matching the unknown speaker data to these models, the traditional approach to speaker recognition. The resultant scores are fused with an equivalent set of scores produced by matching the known speaker utterance to models built on the unknown speaker data. Significant improvements have been achieved using this technique on the NIST 1996, 1997 and 1998 Speaker Recognition Evaluation data. Results are presented for two speaker recognition systems, the first based on Hidden Markov models and the second based on Gaussian Mixture models.\n",

Although at an early stage in its development, SNP's output can be interpolated with that of our GMM system to outperform state-of-the-art GMM's.

    "This paper investigates a method of creating robust speaker models that are not sensitive to session-dependent (SD) utterance-variation and handset-dependent (HD) distortion for HMM-based speaker verification systems in a real telephone network. We recently reported a method of creating session-independent (SI) speaker-HMMs that are not sensitive to SD utterance-variation. In that method, the distortion function that transforms SI speaker-HMMs to SD speaker-HMMs is introduced, and the parameters in the function and the speaker-HMM parameters are jointly estimated using a speaker adaptive training algorithm. This paper proposes a method that is less sensitive to SD utterance-variation and HD distortion than the previous method. This new idea focuses on different difficulties in estimating parameters in distortion functions for SD utterance-variation and HD distortion. In text-independent verification experiments using telephone speech data, the error reduction rate of the improved method compared with that of the conventional method of cepstral mean normalization is 24%.\n",

It is also found that creating a client-model by adapting the means and mixture weights from the non-client model while keeping variances constant works comparably to variance flooring and is much simpler.

The core of the system is a set of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) trained to discriminate between client and an independent set of world speakers. Each MLP is dedicated to work with data segments that are previously selected as belonging to a particular class. Issues and potential advantages of the segmental approach are presented. Performances of global and segmental approaches are tested on the NIST'98 database (250 female and 250 male speakers), showing promising results for the proposed new segmental approach. Comparison with a state of the art system, based on Gaussian Mixture Modelling is also included.\n",

The algorithm is developed based on a sequential detection scheme which is asymptotically optimal in the sense of detecting a possible change in distribution as reliably and quickly as possible. The scheme is extended to HMM decoding in determining the state segmentations for likelihood or other score computations. As a sequential scheme, it can determine a state boundary in a few time steps after it occurs. The examples in this paper show that the proposed algorithm is 5 to 9 times faster than the Viterbi algorithm while it still can provide the same or similar decoding results. The proposed algorithm can be applied to speaker recognition, audio segmentation, voice/silence detection, and many other applications, where an assumption of the algorithm is usually satisfied.\n",

The problem addressed in this paper is text prompted speaker verification by means of phoneme dependent Radial Basis Function networks trained by gradient descent error minimisation. In this context ensemble techniques are introduced by combining different classifiers that classify feature vectors, which have been pre-processed using different linear transforms. Four different types of linear transforms are studied: the Fisher transform, the LDA transform, the PCA transform and the cosine transform. The verification system is evaluated on the Gandalf database, where the equal error rate is reduced from 3.6% to 3.2% when ensemble techniques are introduced.\n",

The projection model technique is evaluated on the Gandalf database and compared to conventional Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).

In addition, it is shown that the VQGMM system is less computationally complex than the traditional GMM, yielding a system which is quicker to train and which gives higher performance. We also investigate four different VQ distance measures which can be used in the training of a VQGMM and compare their respective performances.

    "Statistics of frame-level pitch have recently been used in speaker recognition systems with good results. Although they convey useful long-term information about a speaker's distribution of f0 values, such statistics fail to capture information about local dynamics in intonation that characterize an individual's speaking style. In this work, we take a first step toward capturing such suprasegmental patterns for automatic speaker verification. Specifically, we model the speaker's f0 movements by fitting a piecewise linear model to the f0 track to obtain a stylized f0 contour. Parameters of the model are then used as statistical features for speaker verification. We report results on 1998 NIST speaker verification evaluation. Prosody modeling improves the verification performance of a cepstrum-based Gaussian mixture model system (as measured by a task-specific Bayes risk) by 10%.\n",

    "Current language identification systems vary significantly in their complexity. The systems that use higher level linguistic information have the best performance. Nevertheless, that information is hard to collect for each new language. The system presented in this paper is easily extendable to new languages because it uses very little linguistic information. In fact, the presented system needs only one language specific phone recogniser (in our case the Portuguese one), and is trained with speech from each of the other languages. With the SpeechDat-M corpus, with 6 European languages (English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish) our system achieved an identification rate of 83.4% on 5-second utterances, this result shows an improvement of 5% over our previous version, mainly through the use of a neural network classifier. Both the baseline and the full system were implemented in realtime.\n",

    "We present a novel approach to Automatic Language Identification (LID). We propose Perceptually Guided Training (PGT), a novel LID training method, involving identification of utterance parts which are particularly significant perceptually for the language identification process, and exploitation of these Perceptually Significant Regions (PSRs) to guide the LID training process. Our approach involves a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as the main mechanism. We propose that, because of the long-range intra-utterance acoustical context significance in LID, RNNs are particularly suitable for the LID task. Our approach does not require phonetic labeling or transcription of the training corpus. LIREN/PGT, the LID system we developed, incorporates our approach. Our LID experiments were on English, German, and Mandarin Chinese, using the OGI-TS corpus.\n",

The aim is to remove less relevant components and reduce system sensitivity to acoustic disturbances while improving verification accuracy. Spectral components between about 0.1Hz and 10Hz are found to contain the most useful speaker information. We discuss this result in the context of RASTA processing and cepstral mean subtraction. When compared to cepstral mean subtraction that retains components up to 50Hz, lowpass filtering to 10Hz with downsampling by 75 percent is found to significantly improve robustness in mismatched conditions. The downsampling results in a large computational savings.\n",

    "The subject of computer generated virtual characters is a diverse and rapidly developing field, with a wide variety of applications in industries as varied as entertainment, education and advertising. Many of these applications require or would be greatly enhanced by having the virtual characters speak with the recorded voice of a real person. Such an ability is particularly useful in applications where users are interacting via avatars in real time in a virtual world. There are three basic problems which need to be addressed when developing an interface which has this functionality. *) The process must be capable of animating mouth shapes in real time. *) The process should not mouth extraneous sounds such as music, doors slamming etc. To do so would diminish the effectiveness of the illusion. *) The mouth shapes produced by the avatar should approximate that of the speaker. This paper describes a series of experiments which attempt to address each of the points outlined above. The experimental procedures are based around a real time low computation approach which relies on a particular variety of neural network known as the Single Layer Look Up Perceptron (SLLUP).\n",

The impact of nature of the noise. How can help the visual information to identify the place of articulation? Does the voices of different class of excitation get the same visual support? In order to answer these questions we have performed intelligibility study on consonants between the same vowel supported or not by the speaker's image with different signal to noise ratio.

    "Recent developments in distributed system processing have opened the doors to the running of highly complex systems over a number of networked computers. This enables the complexity of a system to be hidden behind a small, lightweight user interface - for example a downloadable web page. The Maya system makes use of such interfaces to combine the functionality of speech recognition, synthesis, robust parsing, text generation and dialogue management into a highly flexible multimodal architecture, working in real time. This paper describes the development of the architecture and interfaces to each system component. The configuration of the system to particular tasks is discussed, making use of an email secretary task as an example. Once configured, the system is able to adopt all the functionality of a conventional email system and extend these capabilities by allowing complex queries to be made about mail messages.\n",

The objective of the proposed modifications is to improve the recognizer performance on a corpus of human-human dialogues, spontaneously uttered. Some solutions will be given to increase Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) robustness with respect to typical spontaneous speech phenomena such as: breaths, coughs, filled and silent pauses and speaking rate variations. Both gender independent and dependent models are used. Specific models of extra-linguistic phenomena are trained and a method for coping with speaking rate variations will be proposed. Different recognizers, corresponding to males, females and to various speaking rate factors, are combined together so as a unique search space is defined. Best performance, obtained on a corpus of hundreds of person-to-person spontaneously uttered dialogues, gives 26.1% Word Error Rate (WER).\n",

The animated character interactively guides the user through some sights of the city of Darmstadt. It can display and explain how to get to different places of interest by moving around and pointing at locations on a map. The system allows input via mouse clicks, speech and typed text. Output modalities of the agent are speech, gesture, text (cartoon word balloons) and some facial expression. Further we have designed two new 3D characters.

    "To investigate the nature of facial information involved in the integration of audiovisual speech perception, we examined the influence of facial views on the McGurk effect under two auditory conditions. While the speech perception of most of the audiovisual syllables used was little affected by the facial views and the auditory noise, a stronger McGurk effect was obtained for the 3/4-view image uttering labial sounds presented with auditory syllables of alveolars under the auditory noise. However, the facial view did not affect the visual identification of labials in the same way. These results suggest that the information about labial or nonlabial is not the only facial information involved in the McGurk effect. It appears some other information available only in the 3/4-view image might also be involved in the McGurk effect. Implications for the processing of visual, auditory and audiovisual speech are discussed.\n",

    "Cultural similarities and differences were compared between Japanese and North American subjects in the recognition of emotion. Seven native Japanese and five native North Americans (four Americans and one Canadian) subjects participated in the experiments. The materials were five meaningful words or short-sentences in Japanese and American English. Japanese and American actors made vocal and facial expression in order to transmit six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Three presentation conditions were used-auditory, visual, and audio-visual. The audio-visual stimuli were made by dubbing the auditory stimuli on to the visual stimuli. The results show: (1) subjects can more easily recognize the vocal expression of a speaker who belongs to their own culture, (2) Japanese subjects are not good at recognizing 'fear' in both the auditory-alone and visual-alone conditions, (3) and both Japanese and American subjects identify the audio-visually incongruent stimuli more often as a visual label rather than as an auditory label. These results suggest that it is difficult to identify the emotion of a speaker from a different culture and that people will predominantly use visual information to identify emotion.\n",

For auditory speech recognition, there exist many methods for dealing with channel characteristics and speaker individualities, e.g., CMN (cepstral mean normalization), SAT (speaker adaptive training). We present two techniques similar to CMN and SAT, respectively, for intensity and location normalization in visual speech recognition. For the intensity normalization, the mean value over the image sequence is subtracted from each pixel of the image secuence. For the location normalization, the training and the testing processes are carried out by finding the lip position with the highest likelihood of each utterance for HMMs. Word recognition experiments based on HMM show that a significant improvement in recognition performance is achieved by combining the two techniques.\n",

It decomposes the complex shape into two layers: the global shape including the position, scale and rotation of local shapes (such as eyes, nose, mouth and chin); the local simple shape in normal form. The two layers describe the global variation and local variation respectively, and are combined into a probability framework.

    "The integration of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis and animation of synthetic faces allows new applications like visual human computer interfaces using agents or avatars. The TTS informs the talking head when phonemes are spoken. The appropriate mouth shapes are animated and rendered while the TTS produces the sound. We call this integrated system of TTS and animation a Visual TTS (VTTS). This paper describes the architecture on an integrated VTTS synthesizer that allows defining facial expressions as bookmarks in the text that will be animated while the model is talking. The position of a bookmark in the text defines the start time for the facial expression. The bookmark itself names the expression, its amplitude and the duration during which the amplitude has to be reached by the face. A bookmark to face animation parameter (FAP) converter creates a curve defining the amplitude for the given FAP over time using Hermite functions of 3rd order [http://www.research.att.com/info/osterman].\n",

    "A novel algorithm is proposed which generates three-dimensional face point trajectories for a given speech file. The proposed algorithm first employs an off-line training phase. In this phase, recorded face point trajectories along with their speech data and phonetic labels are used to generate phonetic codebooks. These codebooks consist of both acoustic and visual features. During the synthesis stage, speech input is rated in terms of its similarity to the codebook entries, and a weight is assigned to each codebook entry. If the phonetic information about the test speech is available, this is utilized in restricting the codebook search to only several codebook entries which are visually closest to the current phoneme. These weights are then used to synthesize the principal components of the face point trajectory. The performance of the algorithm is tested on held-out data, and the synthesized face point trajectories showed a correlation of 0.73 with true face point trajectories.\n",

    "This paper proposes a method to re-estimate output visual parameters for speech-to-lip movement synthesis using audio-visual Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) under the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm. In the conventional methods for speech-to-lip movement synthesis, there is a synthesis method estimating a visual parameter sequence through the Viterbi alignment of an input acoustic speech signal using audio HMMs. However, the HMM-Viterbi method involves a substantial problem that incorrect HMM state alignment may output incorrect visual parameters. The problem in the HMM-Viterbi method is caused by the deterministic synthesis process to assign a single HMM state for an input audio frame. The proposed method avoids the deterministic process by re-estimating non-deterministic visual parameters while maximizing the likelihood of the audio-visual observation sequence under the EM algorithm.\n",

    "We present a computational model of sensory-grounded language acquisition. Words are learned from naturally spoken multiword utterances paired with color images of objects. Speech recognition and computer vision algorithms are used to build representations of the input speech and images. Words are learned by first clustering images along shape and color dimensions. A search algorithm then finds speech segments within the continuous multiword input speech which co-occur with each visual cluster. The learned words can be used in a speech understanding task to request images based on spoken descriptions and in a speech generation task to automatically generate spoken descriptions of images. Although simple in its current form, this model is a first step towards a more complete, fully-grounded model of language acquisition. Practical applications include adaptive human-machine interfaces based on spoken language for information browsing, assistive technologies, education, and entertainment.\n",

    "The Multi-Stream automatic speech recognition approach was investigated in this work as a framework for Audio-Visual data fusion and speech recognition. This method presents many potential advantages for such a task. It particularly allows for synchronous decoding of continuous speech while still allowing for some asynchrony of the visual and acoustic information streams. First, the Multi-Stream formalism is briefly recalled. Then, on top of the Multi-Stream motivations, experiments on the M2VTS multimodal database are presented and discussed. To our knowledge, these are the first experiments addressing multi-speaker continuous Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). It is shown that the Multi-Stream approach can yield improved Audio-Visual speech recognition performance when the acoustic signal is corrupted by noise as well as for clean speech.\n",

    "The present report outlines differences between multimodal and unimodal communication patterns in linguistic features associated with ease of dialogue tracking and ambiguity resolution. A simulation method was used to collect data while participants used spoken, pen-based, or multimodal input during spatial tasks with a dynamic system. Users' linguistic constructions were analyzed for differences in the rates of reference, co-reference, definite and indefinite referring expressions, and deictic terms. Differences also were summarized in the prevalence of linguistic indirection. Results indicate that spoken language contains substantially higher levels of referring and co-referring expressions and also linguistic indirection, compared with multimodal language communicated by the same users completing the same task. In contrast, multimodal language not only has fewer referential expressions and relatively little anaphora, it also specifically lacks the regular use of determiners observed in spoken definite and indefinite noun phrases. In addition, multimodal language is distinct in its high levels of deictic reference. Implications of these findings are discussed for the relative ease of natural language processing for speech-only versus multimodal systems.\n",

The architecture is currently deployed in a working system supporting interaction with dynamic maps using speech and pen, but the approach is more general and extends to a wide variety of other potential multimodal interfaces.\n",

    "This paper proposes a mechanism that contributes to the implementation of a spoken dialogue system with which a user can communicate effortlessly. In a dialogue, exchanges between participants promote the establishment of shared information and this leads to effortless communication. This is called \"dialogue coordination\". In particular, revealing the respondent's internal state, such as through nodding and back-channel feedback, promotes the establishment of shared information. This is called \"manifestation\", which is one aspect of coordinative behavior, and a mechanism for handling manifestation is introduced. In a human-human dialogue, the listener's manifestative behavior often occurs during a speaker's utterance. However, systems using conventional speech recognition technologies cannot respond during the speaker's utterance. In order to solve this problem, the proposed mechanism, ISTAR protocol transmission, utilizes the intermediate speech recognition results without waiting for the end of the speaker's utterance. This realizes a system with flexible manifestative behavior.\n",

    "Despite the recent growth and potential utility of speech archives, we currently lack tools for effective archival access. Previous research on search of textual archives has assumed that the system goal should be to retrieve sets of relevant documents, leaving users to visually scan through those documents to identify relevant information. However, in previous work we show that in accessing real speech archives, it is insufficient to only retrieve \"document\" sets [9,10]. Users experience huge problems of local navigation in attempting to extract relevant information from within speech \"documents\". These studies also show that users address these problems by taking handwritten notes. These notes detail both the content of the speech and serve as indices to help access relevant regions of the archive. From these studies we derive a new principle for the design of speech access systems: What You See Is (Almost) What You Hear. We present a new user interface to a broadcast news archive, designed on that principle.\n",

In this paper, we will describe recent studies we have carried out on the system, aimed in two directions: handling of non speech sounds in the speech signal (we consider lips, respiration and click noises); and making the preselection lists dynamic in length, to reduce computational load, in the average. In the first case, we want to model non speech sounds, as these effects are crucial in real-life situations, leading to wrong endpointing and increasing error rates. In the second, we are interested in integrating any available system parameter to calculate the preselection list length to use, having applied both parametric and non parametric methods.\n",

We've also developed a recognition board with a single DSP, which works 100-word vocabulary using only the internal memory inside the DSP. [1][2] In this report, we propose a new technique which makes our recognition method more robust, where a newly introduced noise standard template together with traditional phoneme standard templates for calculating phoneme similarity vector realizes precise word-spotting. When the newly proposed noise robustness method was tested with 100 isolated word vocabulary speech of 50 subjects, recognition accuracy of 94.7% was obtained under various noisy environments.\n",

The tone recogniser is an essential component of any automatic speech recognition system customised for tone languages such as Taiwanese. We show that it is difficult to distinguish between the Taiwanese tones simply employing the fundamental frequency contours and that the task is simplified by employing energy contour features besides the fundamental frequency features.  To allow energy to be accommodated into the classification model an energy-contour feature extraction approach is presented. The proposed approach is inspired by the ADSR model employed in musical instrument synthesis where the envelopes of complex sounds are modeled employing only a few parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that the inclusion of energy into the recognition model allows the seven Taiwanese tones to be discriminated successfully. The paper also presents acoustical measurements of the fundamental frequency and energy features described\n",

    "Spectral/temporal segment features are adapted for isolated word recognition and tested with the entire English alphabet set using Hidden Markov Models. The ISOLET database from OGI and the HTK toolkit from Cambridge university were used to test our feature extraction technique. With our feature set we were able to achieve 97.3% recognition accuracy on test data with one pass using a whole word based recognizer. Gaussian noise was also added to evaluate robustness of the feature set. We were able to obtain recognition accuracies of 49.6% and 84.3% at SNR of -10dB and 0dB, respectively. Linear discriminant analysis was also applied to the initial feature set for a number of feature configurations and noise levels but, generally, the performance was not improved. We conclude that the initial feature computations used are both very efficient (best results obtained with 50 total features) and robust in the presence of noise.\n",

The best performance was a word error rate of 0.42% for known length strings obtained using context dependent models. The word error rate was measured as a function of the training data size. The result showed that at least 3302 samples per speaker and 344 speakers are necessary and sufficient for context independent training. Error analysis was conducted on a fraction of the population bearing the major part of recognition errors. The results suggested that such speakers arise not simply from speaker characteristics but from a combination of speaker characteristics and environmental conditions.\n",

In this system each isolated word is decomposed into a sequence of subwords, each of which is identified by means of a particular semi-continuous hidden Markov model that is named a subword HMM. Each isolated word is recognized by a particular set of concatenated subword HMMs that is designated as a word HMM. Subword boundaries within a word are detected by finding peaks of the magnitude of delta cepstral vectors obtained from the word. The system attains average word recognition rates over 87 % for a number of Japanese words uttered by ten native male speakers.\n",

The nonstationary autoregressive (AR) hidden markov model (HMM) with gain contour is proposed for modeling the statistical characteristics of the speech signal. The parameter of nonstationary AR model was modeled by the polynomial function with linear combination of M known basis functions. In this proposed model, speech signal is blocked by samples into fixed-length frames and modeled by nonstationary AR model controlled by markov switching sequences at each frame.

    "This paper proposes a speech recognition method alternative to the conventional sample-based statistical methods which are characterized by the necessity of large amounts of training speech data. To resolve this type of heavy processing, the proposed method employs an intermediate phonetic code system and the calculation of distance between phonetic code sequences in symbolic domain. It realizes high efficiency when compared with direct processing of acoustic correlates, although some deterioration will be expected in recognition scores. We first describe the distance calculation method and present specific procedures for obtaining the intermediate code sequence from input utterances and for spotting words using the calculation of distance in the symbolic domain. Preliminary experiments were examined on isolated word recognition and phrase spotting in continuous speech. Word recognition results indicate that the recognition scores obtained by the proposed method are comparable compared with ordinary phone-HMM-based speech recognition.\n",

    "Hidden Markov modeling of speech waveforms is studied and applied to speech recognition of clean and noisy signals. Signal vectors in each state are assumed Gaussian with zero mean and a Toeplitz covariance matrix. This model allows short signal vectors and thus is useful for speech signals with rapidly changing second order statistics. It can also be straightforwardly adapted to noisy signals especially when the noise is additive and independent of the signal. Since no closed form solution exists for the maximum likelihood estimate of the Toeplitz covariance matrices, an expectation-maximization procedure was used and efficiently implemented. HMM's with Toeplitz as well as asymptotically Toeplitz (e.g., circulant, autoregressive) covariance matrices are theoretically and experimentally studied. While asymptotically all of these matrices provide similar performance, they differ significantly when the frame length is finite. Recognition results are provided for clean and noisy signals at 0-30dB SNR.\n",

    "In this paper we characterize the sensitivity of two speaker-dependent isolated word recognizers toward several kinds of variability and distortions; namely noise, channels, distance to microphone and target language. Both recognizers use a phoneme similarity acoustic front-end as a rich representation for speech from which reliable features are extracted. A cross-correlation test showed that a phoneme similarity front-end is more robust to variability and distortions (especially intra-speaker variability) than a LPC cepstral front-end. The first recognizer (Condor) uses a frame-based approach while the second (Pasha) uses the phoneme similarity information contained in a small number of speech segments. The two recognition methods are presented with a special emphasis on the robustness improvements and computational trade-offs that have been made. Experimental results are reported for car noise at different speeds, speakerphone versus handset input in an office environment and several target languages. Recognition accuracy greater than 94% was achieved in a car environment at 60 mph (Condor) and recognition accuracy greater than 95% was achieved for speakerphone input at a distance of 50 cm. in an office environment.\n",

    "To integrate the microphone array processing into speech recognition, we have proposed a speech recognition algorithm based on 3-D Viterbi search, which localizes a target talker considering the likelihood of HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) while performing speech recognition. The performance of the 3-D Viterbi search method depends on the improvement of the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) by the beamforming technique. This paper proposes a novel method based on an adaptive beamforming technique instead of the delay-and-sum beamformer used in our previous study. The speaker-dependent isolated-word recognition experiments were carried out on real environment data to evaluate the effect of the adaptive beamformer. These results showed that the adaptive beamformer drastically improves the recognition performance both for a fixed-position talker and for a moving-talker.\n",

    "In this paper, the acoustic characteristics of sound fields in enclosed rooms are studied in the joint presence of speech and noise, in order to design a broadband microphone array system capable of coping with both coherent and diffuse noises. Several state-of-the-art speech enhancement array structures are presented and compared to our new system in terms of correct word recognition rates in a simple command and control task. The proposed structure, based on a broadband subband-nested array, performs real-time estimations of the spatial coherence in order to determine the coherent/diffuse nature of the different subbands, using different filters in each case, improving also the classical Wiener post-filter, typically used for diffuse noise supression, for proper cancellation of coherent noises. The results obtained with a 15-channel simultaneous recording database in different reverberation and noise conditions show better performance than other structures previously proposed.\n",

By combining the idea of the minimax decision rule with a normal Viterbi search, we derive a recursive minimax search algorithm, where the minimax decision rule is repetitively applied to determine the partial paths during the search procedure. Because of its intrinsic nature of a recursive search, the proposed method can be easily extended to perform continuous speech recognition. Experimental results on Japanese isolated digits and TIDIGITS, where the mismatch between training and testing conditions is caused by additive white Gaussian noise, show the viability and efficiency of the proposed minimax search algorithm.\n",

The results are particularly pronounced for reverberant test conditions that have not been incorporated into the training set. In the present study, phone- and syllable-based systems are combined at three distinct levels of the recognition process --- the frame, the syllable and the entire utterance. Each strategy successfully integrates the complementary strengths of the individual systems, yielding a significant improvement in accuracy on a small-vocabulary, naturally spoken, telephone speech corpus. The syllable-level combination outperformed the other two methods under both relatively pristine and moderately reverberant acoustic conditions, yielding a 20-40% relative improvement over the baseline.\n",

    "Earlier work in parametric modeling of distortions for robust speech recognition has focussed on estimating the distortion parameter using maximum likelihood and other techniques as a point in the parameter space, and treating this estimate as if it is the true value in a plug-in maximum a posteriori(MAP) decoder. This approach is deficient in most real environments where, due to many reasons, the value of the distortion parameter varies significantly. In this paper we introduce an approach which combines the power of parametric transformation and Bayesian prediction to solve this problem. Instead of approximating the distortion parameter with a point estimate, we average over its variation, thus taking into consideration the distribution of the parameter as well. This approach provides more robust performance than the conventional maximum-likelihood approach. It also provides the solution that minimizes the overall error given the distribution of the parameter. We present results to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the predictive approach.\n",

In this paper we 1) propose a procedure to record Lombard data which provides a good approximation of realistic conditions and 2) present a comparison between two sets of experiments where subjects are in communication with a device while listening to noise through open-ear headphones and where subjects are reading a list. By studying acoustic correlates of the Lombard reflex and performing off-line speaker-independent recognition experiments it is shown that the communication factor affects the Lombard reflex. We also show evidence that several types of noise differing mainly by their spectral tilt induce different acoustic changes. This result reinforces the notion that it is difficult to separate the speaker from the environment stressor (in this case the noise) when studying the Lombard reflex.\n",

The recognition task was performed in the presence of varying levels and types of additive noise and spectral distortion using standard HMM whole-word models with the Bellcore Digit database as a corpus. While all front ends achieved comparable recognition performance in clean speech, the performance of the auditory-model front end was generally significantly higher than other methods in recognition tasks involving background noise or spectral distortion. Training HMMs with speech processed by the auditory-model or L-RASTA front end in one type of noise also improved the recognition performance with other kinds of noise.

    "The problem of removing channel effects from speech has generally been attacked by attempting to recover a time-varying filter which inverts the entire channel impulse response. We show that human listeners are insensitive to many channel conditions and that the human ear seems to respond primarily to discontinu-ities of the channel. As a result of these observations, a partial equalization is proposed in which the channel effects to which the ear is sensitive may be removed, without full inversion of the channel. In addition, it is shown that it is possible to build filters of arbitrary length which do not reduce speech intelligibility and do not produce annoying artifacts.\n",

    "Many stressful environments can deteriorate the performance of speech recognition systems such as aircraft cockpits or high workload task stress/emotional situations. To address this, we investigate a number of linear and nonlinear features and processing methods for stressed speech classification. The linear features include properties of pitch, duration, intensity, glottal source, and the vocal tract spectrum. Nonlinear processing is based on our newly proposed Teager Energy Operator speech feature which incorporates frequency domain critical band filters and properties of the resulting TEO autocorrelation envelope. In this study, we employ a Bayesian hypothesis testing and a hidden Markov model processor as classification methods. Evaluations focused on speech under loud, angry, and the Lombard effect from the SUSAS database. Results using ROC curves and EER based detection show that pitch is the best of the five linear features for stress classification; while the new nonlinear TEO-based feature outperforms the best linear feature by +5.2%, with a reduction in classification rate variability from 8.66 to 3.90.\n",

    "It is well known that the performance of speech recognition algorithms degrade in the presence of adverse environments where a speaker is under stress, emotion, or Lombard effect. This study evaluates the effectiveness of traditional features in recognition of speech under stress and formulates new features which are shown to improve stressed speech recognition. The focus is on formulating robust features which are less dependent on the speaking conditions rather than applying compensation or adaptation techniques. The stressed speaking styles considered are simulated angry and loud, Lombard effect speech, and noisy actual stressed speech from the SUSAS database. In addition, this study investigates the immunity of LP and FFT power spectrum to the presence of stress. Our results show that unlike FFT's immunity to noise, the LP power spectrum is more effective than the FFT to stress as well as to a combination of a noisy and stressful environment. Two alternative frequency partitioning methods (M-MFCC, ExpoLog) are proposed and compared with traditional MFCC features for stressed speech recognition. It is shown that the alternate filterbank frequency partitions are more effective for recognition of speech under both simulated and actual stressed conditions.\n",

    "Robust speech recognition under varying acoustic conditions may be achieved by exploiting multiple sources of information in the speech signal. In addition to an acoustic signal representation, we use an articulatory representation consisting of pseudo-articulatory features as an additional information source. Hybrid ANN/HMM recognizers using either of these representations are evaluated on a continuous numbers recognition task (OGI Numbers95) under clean, reverberant and noisy conditions. An error analysis of preliminary recognition results shows that the different representations produce qualitatively different errors, which suggests a combination of both representations. We investigate various combination possibilities at the phoneme estimation level and show that significant improvements can been achieved under all three acoustic conditions.\n",

    "This paper considers the improvement of speaker identification performance in reverberant conditions using additional lip information. Automatic speaker identification (ASI) using speech characteristics alone can be highly successful, however problems occur with mismatches between training and testing conditions. In particular, we find that ASI performance drops dramatically when given anechoic training but reverberant test speech. Previous work [1][2] has shown that speaker dependant information can be extracted from the static and dynamic qualities of moving lips. Given that lip information is unaffected by reverberation, we choose to fuse this additional information with speech data. We propose a new method for estimating confidence levels to allow adaptive fusion of the audio and visual data. Identification results are presented for increasing levels of artificially reverberated data, where lip information is shown to provide excellent ASI performance improvement.\n",

    "Humans have an excellent ability to select a particular sound source from a noisy environment, called the ``Cocktail-Party Effect'' and to compensate for physically missing sound, called the ``Illusion of Continuity.'' This paper proposes a spectral peak tracker as a model of the illusion of continuity (or phonemic restoration) and a spectral sequence prediction method using a spectral peak tracker. Although some models have already been proposed, they treat only spectral peak frequencies and often generate wrong predicted spectra. We introduce a peak representation of log-spectrum with four parameters: amplitude, frequency, bandwidth, and asymmetry, using the spectral shape analysis method described by the wavelet transformation. And we devise a time-varying second-order system for formulating the trajectories of the parameters. We demonstrate that the model can estimate and track the parameters for connected vowels whose transition section has been partially replaced by white noise.\n",

    "ABSTRACT In this paper we propose a set of features based on group delay spectrum for speech recognition systems. These features appear to be more robust to channel variations and environmental changes compared to features based on Melspectral coefficients. The main idea is to derive cepstrum-like features from group delay spectrum instead of deriving them from power spectrum. The group delay spectrum is computed from modified auto-correlation-like function. The effectiveness of the new feature set is demonstrated by the results of both speaker-independent (SI) and speaker-dependent (SD) recognition tasks. Preliminary results indicate that using the new features, we can obtain results comparable to Mel cepstra and PLP cepstra in most of the cases and a slight improvement in noisy cases. More optimization of the parameters is needed to fully exploit the nature of the new features.\n",

The principle is to identify frame by frame the most noisy subband within four subbands by analysing a SNR-dependent representation. A static partial recogniser is fed with the remaining subbands.

The RNN is employed to estimate the additive bias, which represents the telephone channel effect, in the cepstral domain. Compensation of telephone channel effects is implemented by subtracting the additive bias from the cepstral coefficients of the input utterance. The integrated recognition system is trained based upon MCE/GPD (minimum classification error/generalized probabilistic descent) method with an objective function that is designed to minimize recognition error rate. Experimental results for speaker-independent Mandarin polysyllabic word recognition show an error rate reduction of 21.5% compared to the baseline system.\n",

    "This paper presents a method to improve the robustness of speech recognition in noisy conditions. It has been shown that using dynamic features in addition to static features can improve the noise robustness of speech recognizers. In this work we show that in a continuous-density Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based speech recognition system, weighting the contribution of the dynamic features according to SNR levels can further improve the performance, and we propose a two-step scheme to adapt the weights for a given Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The first step is to obtain the optimal weights for a set of selected SNR levels by discriminative training. The Generalized Probabilistic Decent (GPD) framework is used in our experiments. The second step is to interpolate the set of SNR-specific weights obtained in step one for a new SNR condition. Experimental results obtained by the proposed technique is encouraging. Evaluation using speaker independent digits with added white Gaussian noise shows significant reduction in error rate at various SNR levels.\n",

    "In this paper we propose to introduce backing-off in the acoustic contributions of the local distance functions used during Viterbi decoding as an operationalisation of missing feature theory for increased recognition robustness. Acoustic backing-off effectively removes the detrimental influence of outlier values from the local decisions in the Viterbi algorithm. It does so without the need for prior knowledge that specific features are missing. Acoustic backing-off avoids any kind of explicit outlier detection. This paper provides a proof of concept of acoustic backing-off in the context of connected digit recognition over the telephone, using artificial distortions of the acoustic observations. It is shown that the word error rate can be maintained at the level of 2.5 % obtained for undisturbed features, even in the case where a conventional local distance computation without backing-off leads to a word error rate > 80.0 %.\n",

    "This paper addresses the problem of mismatch between training and testing conditions in a HMM-based speech recognizer. Parallel Model Combination (PMC) has demonstrated to be an efficient technique for reducing the effects of additive noise. In order to apply this technique, a noise HMM must be trained at the recognition phase. Approaches that estimate the noise model based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) or Baum-Welch algorithms are widely used. In these methods the recorded environmental noise data are used, and their major drawback is that they need a long sequence of noise data to estimate properly the model parameters. In some real life applications the amount of noise data can be too small, so from a practical point of view, the needed amount of noise is a critical parameter which should be as short as possible. We propose a novel method for obtaining a more reliable noise model than training it from scratch by using a short noise sequence.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose to use the missing data theory to allow the reconstruction of missing spectro-temporal parameters in the framework of hybrid HMM/ANN systems. A simple signal-to-noise ratio estimator is used to automatically detect the components that are unavailable or corrupted by noise (missing components). A limited number of multidimensional gaussian distributions are then used to reconstruct those missing components solely on the basis of the present data. The reconstructed vectors are then used as input to an artificial neural network estimating the HMM state probabilities. Continuous speech recognition experiments have been done on filtered speech. In this case, filtered components carry few or no information at all, and hence, should probably be ignored. The results presented in this paper illustrate this point of view. Complementary experiments also suggest the interest of the proposed approach in the case of noisy speech.\n",

In this context, new sources of distortion, such as transmission errors or speech coding itself, significantly degrade the performance of speech recognizers. While conventional approaches deal with these types of distortion after decoding speech, we propose to recognize from the digital speech representation of GSM. In particular, our work focuses on the 13 kbit/s RPE-LTP GSM standard speech coder. In order to test our recognizer we have compared it to a conventional recognizer in several simulated situations, which allow us to gain insight into more practical ones. Specifically, besides recognizing from clean digital speech and evaluating the influence of speech coding distortion, the proposed recognizer is faced with speech degraded by random errors, burst errors and frame substitutions. The results are very encouraging: the worse the transmission conditions are, the more recognizing from digital speech outperforms the conventional approach.\n",

Our system has been trained on German spontaneous speech data and has been adapted to navigation queries using MLLR. As the system is not restricted to command word input, a parser further processes the recognized utterance. We show that within a lab environment our system is able to handle arbitrary spontaneous sentences as input to a navigation system successfully.

Its principle consists in an analysis-enhancement-synthesis process based on a linear prediction (LP) model of the signal: the LP filter is enhanced thanks to associative tools that estimate LP cleaned parameters from both noisy audio and visual information. The detailed structure of the system is reminded and we focus on the improvement that concerns precisely the associators: basic neural networks (multi-layers perceptrons) are used instead of linear regression.

Experiments show that the use of the enhanced parameters using such an approach increases the recognition rate of the continuous speech recognition (CSR) process. The HTK Hidden Markov Model Toolkit was used throughout. Experiments were done on a noisy version of the TIMIT database.

    "Speech coding affects speech recognition performance, with recognition accuracy deteriorating as the coded bit rate decreases. Virtually all systems that recognize coded speech reconstruct the speech waveform from the coded parameters, and then perform recognition (after possible noise and/or channel compensation) using conventional techniques. In this paper we compare the recognition accuracy of coded speech obtained by reconstructing the speech waveform with the speech recognition accuracy obtained when using cepstral features derived from the coding parameters. We focus our efforts on speech that has been coded using the 13-kbps full-rate GSM codec, a Regular Pulse Excited Long Term Prediction (RPE-LTP) codec. The GSM codec develops separate representations for the linear prediction (LPC) filter and the residual signal components of the coded speech. We measure the effects of quantization and coding on the accuracy with which these parameters are represented, and present two different methods for recombining them for speech recognition purposes. We observe that by selectively combining the cepstral streams repre senting the LPC parameters and the residual signal it is possible to obtain recognition accuracy directly from the coded parameters that equals or exceeds the recognition accuracy obtained from the reconstructed waveforms.\n",

    "Recognition performance decreases when recognition systems are used over the telephone network, especially wireless network and noisy environments. It appears that non efficient speech/non-speech detection is a very important source of this degradation. Therefore, speech detector robustness to noise is a challenging problem to be examined, in order to improve recognition performance for the very noisy communications. Speech collected in GSM environment gives an example of such very noisy speech to be recognized. Several studies were conducted aiming to improve the robustness of speech/non-speech detection used for speech recognition in adverse conditions. This paper introduces a robust word boundary detection algorithm reliable in the very noisy cellular network environment. The algorithm is based on the statistics of noise and speech in the observed signal. In order to decide on the binary hypotheses of noise only versus speech plus noise, we use a likelihood ratio criterion.\n",

    "In speech recognition for real-world applications, the performance degradation due to the mismatch introduced between training and testing environments should be overcome. In this paper, to reduce this mismatch, we provide a hybrid method of spectral subtraction and residual noise masking. We also employ multiple model approach to obtain improved robustness over various noise environments. In this approach, multiple model sets are made according to several noise masking levels and then a model set appropriate for the estimated noise level is selected automatically in recognition phase. According to speaker independent isolated word recognition experiments in car noise environments, the proposed method using model sets with only two masking levels reduces average word error rate by 60% in comparison with spectral subtraction method.\n",

    "Spectral noise subtraction has the drawback of generating residual noise with musical character, the so-called musical noise. We propose a simple modification of the filter coefficients calculation in form of a recursion to the previous coefficient. This recursion results in a switching mechanism of the spectral subtraction gain, in the way that speech pauses are processed with a nearly constant very low gain and speech components are processed with a nearly constant high gain. Because of the switching mechanism the generation of musical noise is almost completely avoided. The well known approach of Ephraim and Malah has a similar mechanism, but the new recursive scheme is much easier for implementation yet yielding comparable or sometimes better performance than the other approach.\n",

These different models include the channel-mismatch-correct (CMC) model, more-alternative-pronunciation model, tone and non-tone models of Chinese Mandarin speech, voice activity detection(VAD) model and state-skip model.

    "One of the great today's challenges in speech recognition is to ensure the robustness of the used speech representation. Usually, the recognition rate is strongly reduced when the speech is corrupted, e.g. by convolutional or additive noise, and the speech features are not designed to be robust. In this paper we study the effect of additive noise on the logarithmic filter-bank energy representation. We use time and frequency filtering techniques to emphasize the discriminative information and to reduce the mismatch between noisy and clean speech representation. A 2-D spectral representation is introduced to see the regions most affected by noise in the 2-D quefrency-modulation frequency domain and to help to design the frequency and time filter shapes. Experiments with one and two dynamic feature sets show the usefulness of the combination of time and frequency filtering for both, white and low-pass noise speech recognition. At the end the power time and frequency filtering technique is presented.\n",

    "Two types of algorithms are introduced that recover missing time-frequency regions of log-spectral representations of speech. These compensation algorithms modify the incoming feature vector without any changes to the speech recognition system, in contrast to previously-described approaches. The first approach clusters the log-spectral vectors representing clean speech. Missing data are recovered by estimating the spectral cluster in each analysis frame on the basis of the feature values that are present. The second approach uses MAP procedures to estimate the values of missing data elements based on their correlation with the features that are present. Greatest recognition accuracy was obtained using the correlation-based approach, presumably because of its ability to exploit the temporal as well as spectral structure of speech. The recognition accuracy provided by these algorithms approaches but does not exceed that obtained by traditional marginalization. Nevertheless, it is believed that these algorithms provide greater computational efficiency and enable greater flexibility in recognition system structure.\n",

    "We present an approach to joint application of spectral subtraction (SPS) and model combination (PMC) for speech recognition in noisy environments. Contrary to previous solutions distortion introduced by SPS is not modeled in PMC. Instead we ensure compatibility of the two methods by adapting parameters of SPS (spectral floor and overestimation factor) according to the present signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Parameter setting should be done to subtract a maximum of noise while minimizing distortion. Experiments suggest that for each noise level different parameter sets yield optimal performance. Setting the parameters adaptively according to the noise level leads to undegraded results at high SNR while in low SNR regions the benefits of the noise reduction process are significant. This scheme leaves the model combination process unchanged which simplifies parameter estimation and reduces computation time. Experiments show significant improvements when using PMC with modified SPS instead of standard SPS.\n",

The HMM decomposition method separates a composed HMM into a known phoneme HMM and an unknown noise and channel HMM by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the HMM parameters. A transfer function (telephone channel) HMM is estimated using adaptation speech data by applying the HMM decomposition twice in the linear spectral domain for noise and in the cepstral domain for channel. The telephone speech data for evaluation are recorded through 10 kinds of ordinary analog telephone handsets and cordless telephone handsets. The test results show that the average phrase accuracy with the clean speech HMMs is 60.9% for the ordinary analog telephone handsets, and 19.6% for the cordless telephone handsets. By the HMM decomposition method, the average phrase accuracy is improved to 78.1% for the ordinary analog telephone handsets, and 50.5% for the cordless telephone handsets.\n",

This method solves the problem of segregating two acoustic sources by using constraints related to the four regularities proposed by Bregman and by making two improvements to our previously proposed method. One is to incorporate a method of estimating the fundamental frequency using the Comb filtering on the filterbank. The other is to reconsider the constraints on the separation block, which constrain the instantaneous amplitude, input phase, and fundamental frequency of the desired signal. Simulations performed to segregate a vowel from a noisy vowel and to compare the results of using all or only some constraints showed that our improved method can segregate real speech precisely using all the constraints related to the four regularities and that the absence some constraints reduces the accuracy.\n",

The performance of models is examined not only in the isolated word speech recognition task and but also in the speech enhancement task. As the results of experiment, the improvement of robustness in speech recognition task corresponds to about 15-20dB when the surrounding noise is white noise.

The modification aims to improve the discriminative capabilities of the compensated models. It is achieved by the rearrangement of the distributions of state models in order to emphasize the contribution of the mean in the following process. Both distributions of speech model and noise model are shaped in cepstral domain through a covariance contracting procedure. After the compensation steps, an expanding procedure of the adapted covariance is necessary to release the emphasis. Using this process, the discriminative capability is increased so that the recognition accuracy is improved.

The selection of short duration speech segments is based on a local measure of the signal-to-noise ratio calculated over 1ms windows. The aim is to create stimuli with known fluctuations occurring between a speech and noise sample to assess whether the presence of short duration \"gaps\" in the noise produce favourable and unfavourable signal regions that influence identification. Perceptual results are reported that suggest human listeners make better use of signals that comprise only of positive, local signal-to-noise ratio segments. Such regions are assumed to be more favourable for stimuli identification. Presentation of stimuli containing only negative signal-to-noise ratio regions does not appear to contribute as much.

    "A novel method for robust pitch extraction, based on the correlogram output of the Lyon's cochlear model is described. The value of the autocorrelation lag for which the signals of the cochlear channels have the same periodicity can be computed thus tracking how the pitch of the input signal varies in the time domain. In the case of a stationary noise, a sort of 'spectral-subtraction' technique, built in the correlogram domain named 'correlogram subtraction', is applied to enhance the signal before computing its fundamental frequency. Finally, a correction algorithm based on an 'island driven' strategy, working on particular zones of the signal with stable pitch values, is used to refine the pitch estimate. This method of pitch extraction is extremely reliable, even in the case of a signal to noise ratio of 0dB. The same subtraction technique, with some new specific filter-bank energy-based modifications, is considered to re-synthesize, by an inversion strategy, a clean version of an input noisy signal. The quality of the re-synthesized signal is quite promising, leading us to try, in the future, to use this technique as a new signal enhancement scheme.\n",

This models speech and noise using perceptual frequency or `warped' autoregressive HMMs (AR-HMMs) and estimates the clean speech and noise parameters within this framework. In this paper, we investigate the use of our system as a front-end to a clean MFCC recognition system. We make two main modifications to our scheme. First, we use MMSE spectral rather than time domain estimators for enhancement. Second, for computational reasons, we form estimators using non-warped AR-HMMs. To avoid mismatch when converting between warped and non-warped models, we use parallel models. Results are presented for small and medium vocabulary tasks. On the simple task, we approach the performance of a matched system when language model information is included. On the second task, we are unable to incorporate a language model due to modelling deficiencies in AR-HMMs. However, we still demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline results.\n",

    "Much progress has been made in speech enhancement algorithm formulation in recent years. However, while researchers in the speech coding and recognition communities have standard criteria for algorithm performance comparison, similar standards do not exist for researchers in speech enhancement. This paper discusses the necessary ingredients for an effective speech enhancement evaluation. We propose that researchers use the evaluation core test set of TIMIT (192 sentences), with a set of noise files, and a combination of objective measures and subjective testing for broad and fine phone-level quality assessment. Evaluation results include overall objective speech quality measure scores, measure histograms, and phoneme class and individual phone scores. The reported results are meant to illustrate specific ways of detailing quality assessment for an enhancement algorithm.\n",

The technique exploits the human auditory systems inability to distinguish between individual frequency components within critical frequency bands. Spectral subtraction is used and the spectrum is considered as critical frequency bands rather than individual frequency components. The proposed technique is compared with the existing spectral subtraction technique, using both subjective and objective speech assessment measures.

    "This study explores the following hypothesis: forward looping movements of the tongue that are observed in VCV sequences are due partly to the anatomical arrangement of the tongue muscles and how they are used to produce a velar closure. The study uses an anatomically based two-dimensional biomechanical tongue model. Tissue elastic properties are accounted for in finite-element modeling, and movement is controlled by constant-rate control parameter shifts. Tongue raising and lowering movements are produced by the model with the combined actions of the genioglossus, styloglossus and hyoglossus. Simulations of V1CV2 movements were made, where C is a velar consonant and V is [a], [i] or [u]. The resulting trajectories describe movements that begin to loop forward before consonant closure. Examination of subject data show similar looping movements. These observations support the idea that the biomechanical properties of the tongue could be the main factor responsible for the loops.\n",

The output of the force sensor unit at the low stress range of 0-64 kPa (0-5 gw) is proportional to the stress applied to the force sensing unit, with nearly no hysteresis. Measurement error of the force sensor is less than 1.7%. Error by mechanical interference among cantilever-type force sensors is less than 0.2%.

    "This paper presents a method for determining the vocal-tract spectrum from the positions of fixed points on the articulatory organs. The method is based on the search of a database comprised of pairs of articulatory and acoustic data representing the direct relationship between the articulator position and vocal-tract spectrum. To compile the database, the electro-magnetic articulograph (EMA) system is used to measure the movements of the jaw, lips, tongue, velum, and larynx simultaneously with speech waveforms. The spectrum estimation is accomplished by selecting database samples neighboring the input articulator position and interpolating the selected samples. In addition, phoneme categorization of the input position is performed to restrict the search area of the database to portions of the same phoneme category. Experiments show that the mean estimation error is 2.24 dB and the quality of speech synthesized from the estimated spectrum can be improved by using the phoneme categorization.\n",

    "Individual variation of larynx position reflects human morphological differences and thus contributes to generating biological information in speech sounds. This study examines the factors of orofacial morphology that co-vary with larynx position based on MRI data collected for 12 Japanese and 12 English speakers. The materials are midsagittal craniofacial images, and the method is based on the measurement of angles and indices. Among all the measures examined, the aspect ratio of the oral cavity in the lateral view showed the highest correlation (r=0.87) with larynx height index (ratio of arytenoid - palatal plane distance and anterior nasal spine - nasopharyngeal wall distance), and a facial angle (angle of maxillary incisor - nasion - nasopharyngeal wall) showed the second highest correlation (r=0.66) with larynx height index. The result indicates that larynx position co-varies with oral cavity shape, being higher when oral cavity shape is flatter and more prognathic.\n",

    "We present some evidence indicating that phonetic distinctiveness and speaker individuality, are indeed manifested in vowels' vocal-tract (VT) sha pes estimated from the lower and upper formants, respectively. The methodology developed to demonstrate this dichotomy, implicates Schroeder's (1967) acoustic-articulatory model which can be coerced to yield area-function approximations to VT-shapes of differing formant components. Using ten steady-state vowels recorded in /hVd/-context, five times at random, by four adult-male speakers of Australian English, VT-shape variability was then measured on an intra- and an inter-speaker basis. Gross shapes estimated from the lower formants, caused the largest spread amongst the vowels of individual speakers. By contrast, more detailed sha pes estimated from certain higher formants of front and back vowels, caused the largest spread amongst speakers. These results contribute a quasi-articulatory substantiation of a long-standing view on the speaker-specific potency of the upper vowel-formant region, together with some useful implications for speech and speaker recognition.\n",

    "Digital video filming of the thyroid prominence was used to measure larynx height in German vowels, with focus on contrasts involving front unrounded, front rounded and back rounded vowels. The study aimed to provide a foundation for interpreting the acoustic consequences of articulatory maneuvres not only at the larynx but also elsewhere in the vocal tract. Results showed the expected pattern of lower larynx position for the rounded vowels. However no clear preference emerged for the same, more, or less larynx lowering on front rounded versus back rounded vowels. Coarticulatory effects of the flanking consonants were weak. The most striking result was that the magnitude of the differences between vowels varied substantially over speakers. This reinforces the contention that interpretation of vertical laryngeal gestures must be embedded in speaker-specific analysis of downstream articulatory maneuvres. Work in this direction is currently in progress.\n",

    "For voiced speech the main excitation of the vocal tract occurs at the end of the glottal closing phase when the rate of change of the flow reaches its absolute maximum. This study presents a straightforward method that yields a numerical value to characterize the effect of the main excitation on vocal intensity. The method, Energy Ratio by Modified Excitation (ERME), takes advantage of the glottal flow and the model of the vocal tract transfer function given by inverse filtering and it synthesizes two signals based on the source-filter theory. The first synthesized sound is produced using the glottal flow waveform given by inverse filtering per se. The second signal is synthesized by removing the main excitation from the differentiated glottal flow. ERME is defined as the ratio between the energy of the first synthesized signal and the energy of the second one. It is shown that when the loudness of speech increases, the value of ERME first rises but in the case of loud voices it starts to decrease. This behavior of ERME shows that effects of secondary excitations of the vocal tract that occur during glottal opening become important in the production of loud voices.\n",

    "Speech is typically modelled using time-domain or frequency-domain simulations of the acoustic field in the vocal tract. Using a biorthogonal modal decomposition, it is shown that time-domain finite-difference simulations can be transformed algebraically into equivalent formant synthesizers, the parameters of which vary in time and are calculated directly from the laws of physics. Examining the structure of the equivalent formant synthesizer, it is observed that formant excitation is largely due to internal modal coupling effects, induced by rapid perturbation of the acoustic eigenmodes caused by vibration of the glottis, and does not rely precisely on external sources provided by boundary conditions. This leads to a novel interpretation and justification of traditional models of the glottal source.\n",

    "Using fibreoptic laryngoscopy to observe pharyngeal articulations, the aryepiglottic sphincter mechanism is shown to be responsible for the production of speech sounds in the phonetic category \"pharyngeal.\" Major differences in auditory/acoustic quality are also produced when the larynx as a whole is raised or lowered during the production of pharyngeals. The voiceless pharyngeal fricative and voiced pharyngeal approximant are the result of increased sphincteric constriction of the laryngeal \"tube\" in a continuum that begins with normal glottal stop and ventricular fold closure. A pharyngeal stop is produced when the aryepiglottic sphincter mechanism achieves complete closure, and trilling accompanying friction is evident at the pharyngeal place of articulation in both voiceless and voiced modes. It is suggested that all five sounds share a common, pharyngeal place of articulation, but differ in manner of articulation. Raised larynx is the default setting for these articulations, but they may be produced with lowered larynx.\n",

Frequency characteristics of the radiation impedance are computed from simulation results. The simulation results show that the results of FEM simulation are in good agreement with our measurement results. The proposed 3-D radiational model is useful for analysis of the acoustic characteristics of human speech. In the 2nd experiment, the protrusion is attached to our 3-D vocal tract model.

Synchronised acoustic, electromagnetometer, and electropalatographic recordings were analysed. One subject had a higher F0 in the primary stressed syllable. The other two had a longer acoustic duration for the syllable's voiced portion, corresponding to a longer lip closing movement. One of these two also had a larger and faster lip opening movement into the vowel. Taken together, the results show that primary versus secondary lexical stress may be differentiated even when accent contrasts are neutralised, although the differences are inconsistent across talkers and small by comparison to those that have been shown to characterise the accented-unaccented contrast.\n",

    "Following a previous study using locus equation (LE) and electropalatographic (EPG) data to examine coarticulation of voiced consonants and vowels in CV syllables [1], the present study examines voiceless stops and fricatives using the same analysis techniques. It is found that when LE data for stops is sampled at the stop burst, rather than at vowel onset, the correlation between LE data on coarticulation and EPG data on coarticulation is quite high. By contrast, results for the fricatives are quite poor. It is suggested that the LE is capable of capturing rather gross differences in coarticulatory resistance, such as that involving a tongue tip rather than a tongue body, but that it is not capable of capturing more subtle differences in coarticulation, such as those involving different coronal articulations. This explanation is supported by work in progress on Australian Aboriginal languages which have up to four coronal places of articulation [2].\n",

    "The PARAFAC method of factor analysis was used to investigate patterns of tongue shaping in a corpus of 15 German vowels spoken in 3 consonant contexts by 7 speakers at 2 speech rates, using data from electromagnetic articulography. A two-factor model was extracted, giving a succinct, speaker-independent characterization of the German vowel space and of some important coarticulatory effects on vowel articulation. Moreover, the factors appeared to have a plausible physiological substrate. The PARAFAC model places strong constraints on the form that speaker-specific effects can take, since speaker differences must be captured in a single multiplicative weight per speaker and factor. While these constraints appeared acceptable for modelling vocalic aspects of articulation, more consonantally-related aspects, such as coarticulatory behaviour of the tongue-tip, appeared much more difficult to capture in the PARAFAC framework.\n",

    "In this paper the latest prototype Optopalatograph (OPG) is described and its operation is demonstrated graphically and in comparison to theoretical predictions. The system is divided into three parts - the optopalate itself; a separate self contained unit composed of 16 switched infra-red light sources, associated control logic and 16 receivers; and a computer with A/D card running software to analyse and interpret graphically the sensor outputs. The current prototype measures distances of up to 20mm between all of the 16 pre-selected points on the hard palate and the surface of the tongue at a frame rate of 100Hz. We conclude that the new prototype provides a practical measurement system with a subjectively informative real-time display but further development is required in order to obtain objective accuracy.\n",

    "This study examines modifications to the acoustic and affective qualities of infant-direct speech (IDS) from birth to 12 months. The acoustic analysis of fundamental frequency shows that IDS has the highest level of mean fundamental frequency (F 0 ) in speech to infants at 6 months, and the highest level of pitch range in speech to infants at 12 months. Sex-based differences were evident with mothers using higher mean-F 0 and pitch range in speech to female than male infants. The mother's speech samples were also rated on five scales of communicative intent. Two factors, labelled 'Affective' and 'Attentional', were extracted from these scales. Analysis of variance of the derived factor scores shows that mothers have the highest scores on the Affective factor at 6 and 12 months, while the maximum on the Attentional factor occurs at 9 months. Mothers also increase their use of both these IDS components more in speech to girls than boys.\n",

    "Infant Directed Speech (IDS) samples were collected longitudinally from six mothers speaking to their infants (three with female infants and three with male infants) when their infants were newborns, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months of age. Adult Directed Speech (ADS) samples of these mothers were also collected to be compared with these IDS samples. This maternal speech was then examined in terms of the phonetic characteristics, specially the prosodic aspects-pitch, tempo, and loudness. Twenty utterances from each of the six mothers speaking to their infants at each of the five ages and to an adult, totaling 720 utterances (20 utterances x 6 mothers x 6 age groups) were acoustically analyzed. They are fundamental frequencies, frequency ranges, utterance duration, syllable duration, numbers of syllable per utterance, and intensity values. Results of the comparison between IDS and ADS showed that IDS used higher fundamental frequencies (263.3 Hz vs 247.99 Hz), greater frequency range in semitones (15.16 st vs 13.5 st), shorter utterance duration (1106 ms vs 1506 ms), longer syllable duration (343 ms vs 220 ms), and less numbers of syllable per utterance (3.85 vs 7.63). Concerning the age-related changes of prosodic features, there seems to be three age intervals which show unique modification to the pattern of prosodic characteristics. The first age group is the newborns as opposed to other age groups, mothers use longer utterance duration, longer syllable duration, and more numbers of syllable per utterance. In the 3- and the 6-month-old periods, the mothers' speech style changes to an increase of the mean Ff and pitch modulation. By the time the infants reach 9 and 12 months of age, there is a successive decrease of Ff of the speech directed to the 6MO to the 9MO and the 12MO. Most prosodic features of the IDS directed to the 12MO are almost similar to those of the ADS. The study of intensity values in IDS fails to reveal any significant variation due to a general phonetic problem in the instrumental study of the degree of loudness in speech. The variations of the phonetic characteristics among the 6 groups in all aspects were statistically analyzed using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). It was found that every variation of the prosodic features investigated across age groups was statistically significant. It seems that these phonetic characteristics in the mothers' speech are adjusted to accommodate the communicative functions between the mothers and their infants and these functions have developed according to other developments of the infants.\n",

    "A longitudinal study of the pragmatic characteristics of the Infant Directed Speech (IDS) of middle class Thai mothers when talking to their babies at birth (Newborn), and when the infants were 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months-old was conducted. Three aspects were investigated: (1) the verbal acts which the mothers use with their infants using the framework of Thai linguistic action verbs (LAVs), and speech act verbs (SAVs) found in IDS; (2) the use of interrogative sentences in IDS both in quantitative and qualitative terms, and (3) the use of final particles incorporating both the status and mood particles which the mothers use in IDS. Regarding SAVs, overall IDS was made up of 38.6% expressives, 23.2% assertives, 20% directives, 15.3% questions, and 2.4% interaction-management. Comparison of SAVs in IDS directed to the five age groups shows a similarity in the pragmatic characteristics of the 3-and 6-month-olds, as opposed to the 9- and 12-month-olds. IDS to Newborns is unique compared with these two groups. It was found that 27.8 % of the IDS utterances were interrogatives, with a peak incidence of interrogatives at 3 months. The incidence of Yes-No interrogatives decreased as the age of the infants increased, whereas the incidence of WH- interrogatives increased as the age of the infants increased. Regarding the type of information mothers were seeking in WH- interrogatives, VP information-seeking is prominent for the Newborn and 3-month speech, but decreased as the infants got older. NP information-seeking was low for speech to the Newborns and 3-month-olds, and increased in speech to the 6-, 9-, and 12-month-olds. The information-seeking in adjuncts (location, time, manner etc.) was high in the 9- and 12-month-olds, when the infants were able to move about and started to explore their physical world. Interrogatives are used mostly for didactic functions; mothers asked and then answered the questions themselves. A large number of repetitive question forms are found, and these are used to draw the attention of infants in the mother-child interaction. Analysis of the use of the final particles reflects very clear didactic and emotive functions in IDS. The pragmatic characteristics of IDS during the first twelve months of the infants' lives varied significantly across ages. Mothers adapted their communication strategies in talking to their babies. These variations were found to help accommodate the mother-child interaction from the time when the infants were not able to communicate at all (Newborns), to the time when they started to communicate with nonverbal acts such as gazing, smiling and crying with eye contact (3 to 6 months), and in turn to the time when they started to communicate with hand touching and rudimentary verbal communication (9 to 12 months). IDS input is not just input data for infants to learn linguistic forms, but plays an important role in the development of the linguistic behaviour with the ultimate goal of communicating with other human beings successfully.\n",

    "It has been suggested that infant-directed speech (IDS) is a special speech register conducive to gaining infants' attention, eliciting and expressing affect, and teaching infants about the phonology of the ambient language. Certain similarities have been observed between IDS and pet-directed speech (PDS), but until now these have not been systematically studied. In this study IDS, PDS, and adult directed speech (ADS) are compared on acoustic, phonetic, and affective measures. It has been suggested that IDS should be more tuned to a linguistic didactic function than PDS, but that the two should be similar acoustically and affectively. The results show that IDS and PDS are generally different from ADS, but that IDS and PDS do not differ substantially, either acoustically, or phonetically. As the expected difference between IDS and PDS was not obtained, it could be suggested that dependent variables thought to measure the functions of special speech registers may not necessarily do so unequivocally.\n",

    "This paper describes a speaker adaptation technique for a phonetic vocoder based on HMM. In the vocoder, the encoder performs phoneme recognition and transmits phoneme indexes and state durations to the decoder, and the decoder synthesizes speech using HMM-based speech synthesis technique. One of the main problems of this vocoder is that the voice characteristics of synthetic speech depend on HMMs used in the decoder, and are therefore fixed regardless of a variety of input speakers. To overcome this problem, we adapt HMMs to input speech by transmitting transfer vectors, information on mismatch between the input speech and HMMs. The results of the subjective tests show that the performance of the proposed vocoder without quantization of transfer vectors is comparable to that of a speaker dependent vocoder.\n",

The coder is based on the same building blocks as the 8 kbit/s G.729 to facilitate low complexity extensions to G.729 in terms of additional memory usage. It is fully switchable with the 8 kbit/s coder and provides additional flexibility to existing and emerging G.729 applications. The fixed codebook is a 2-pulse algebraic codebook. The adaptive codebook quantization has been changed and a new conjugate structure gain codebook is used. In order to compensate for the sparser algebraic codebook, an adaptive post-processing technique is used to enhance the quality for unvoiced speech and background noise sounds. Subjective tests have indicated that the coder has a performance close to that of G.729, and equivalent to that of G.723.1 at 6.3 kbit/s for speech.\n",

    "In voice coding applications where there is no constraint on the encoding delay, segment coding techniques can be used to achieve a reduction in data rate. For low data rate linear predictive coding schemes, increasing the encoding delay allows one to exploit any long term temporal stationarities on an interframe basis, thus reducing the transmission bandwidth or storage needs of the speech signal. Transform coding has previously been applied in low data rate speech coding to exploit both the interframe and the intraframe correlation [1][6][8]. This paper investigates the potential of an adaptive transformation scheme for a segmented parametric speech representation. The problem of transform quantization is formulated and a solution methodology was proposed. The potential benefit of the use of the proposed adaptive transformation scheme is discussed in the context of segmented LSPs.\n",

    "Telephone speech is typically bandlimited to 4 kHz, resulting in a 'muffled' quality. Coding speech with bandwidth greater than 4 kHz reduces this distortion, but requires a higher bit rate to avoid other types of distortion. An alternative to coding wider bandwidth speech is to exploit correlation between the 0-4 kHz and 4-8 kHz speech bands to re-synthesize wideband speech from narrowband speech. This paper presents a method for re-synthesizing narrowband coded speech using sinusoidal transform coding (STC), modified codebook mapping and a novel method for the synthesis of highband unvoiced components. Informal listening test results indicate that this method produces a significant quality improvement in speech which has been coded using narrowband standards.\n",

Rules for the optimum choice of a and b are derived, based on both theoretical analysis and experimental results. The effects of noise on the SEEVOC algorithm are also investigated.

    "This paper proposes a recognition-synthesis approach to speech coding which uses a formant trajectory model for both recognition and synthesis. It is argued that this unified approach to coding has the potential to achieve low data rates whilst preserving speech quality and paralinguistic information. A simple coding scheme is described which establishes the principles of this approach. Formant analysis is applied to the input speech, and the formant features are input to a linear-trajectory segmental hidden Markov model recognizer to locate segment boundaries. The formant parameters for each segment are coded using a linear trajectory description, and used to drive a parallel-formant synthesizer to reproduce the utterance at the receiver. The coding method has been tested on utterances from a variety of speakers. In the current system, which has not yet been optimised for coding efficiency, speech is typically coded at 600-1000 bits/s with good intelligibility, whilst preserving speaker characteristics.\n",

First, we examine the audibility of cyclostationary narrow-band noise added to voiced speech generated by synthetic excitation. Varying the temporal location of noise within a pitch cycle corresponds to varying its phase spectrum. Using this fact, we find that a phase change of the noise in the high frequency region is more perceptible for a low-pitched sound than for a high-pitched sound. We propose a pitch-dependent temporal weighting function and we show experimentally that it is beneficial to the quantization of pitch-cycle waveforms.\n",

In this technique, IIR filters replace the conventional FIR filters of the PSWT, offering computational and spectral magnitude performance advantages, in addition to significant delay reductions. Previously, the PSWT has only incorporated filter banks with slowly reacting FIR wavelet filters. While these filters possess the desirable properties of linear phase, and design simplicity, a large delay is incurred which increases exponentially with increasing resolution. The progression to IIR filter banks gives rise to a multi-resolution decomposition mechanism, beneficial for real-time applications, such as speech coding, where delay is an important issue.\n",

    "A new linear predictive method is presented in this study. The method, Linear Prediction with Linear Extrapolation (LPLE), reformulates the computation of linear prediction by combining the preceding values of sample x(n) into consecutive sample pairs (i.e., x(n-2i), x(n-2i+1)). Each of these pairs determines a regression line the value of which at time instant n is used as a data sample in the prediction. The optimal LPLE-predictor is obtained by minimizing the square of the prediction error using the autocorrelation method. The rationale for the new method is the fact that LPLE yields an all-pole filter of order 2p when the number of unknowns in the normal equations equals p. Therefore the new all-pole modeling method can be used in speech coding applications. Preliminary experiments of the present study show that LPLE is able to model speech spectra more accurately in comparison to conventional linear prediction in the case when a very small number of prediction parameters is required to be used in order to greatly compress the spectral information of speech signals.\n",

    "The authors propose a new approach to Temporal Decomposition (TD) of characteristic parameters of speech for very low rate coding applications. The method models the articulatory dynamics employing a hierarchical error minimization algorithm which does not use Singular Value Decomposition. It is also much faster than conventional TD and could be implemented in real-time. High flexibility is achieved with the proposed method to comply with the desired coding requirements, such as compression ratio, accuracy, delay, and computational complexity. This method can be used for coding spectral parameters at rates 1000-1200 b/s with high fidelity and an algorithmic delay of less than 150 msec.\n",

    "There are several tests of speech intelligibility currently available which employ a variety of methods. The most appropriate method for testing intelligibility of speech transmitted via telephony is a forced choice task in which listeners hear speech samples and identify what they hear from among a set of alternatives displayed onscreen. This methodology allows tests to be run quickly and scored automatically. A major flaw in existing forced-choice intelligibility tests is the use of unfamiliar words, nonwords, and proper names along with common words. A stimulus set that is mixed in this way may introduce response biases into the test and therefore produce results that are less predictive of actual intelligibility performance. The Intelligibility of Familiar Items Test (IFIT) ameliorates several methodological flaws found in earlier tests. The IFIT uses a stimulus set composed of high familiarity real English words and tests consonants in initial and final word position and vowels in word medial position.\n",

    "In this paper, a very low bit speech coder at 1.2 Ops is newly proposed. Like the LPC vocoder, it requires few types of information (power, pitch, and spectral information), but its quality is far superior. In the proposed vocoder, the synthesized speech quality is improved based on auditory perceptual characteristics. The synthesis method is one of harmonic coding, using sinusoids whose frequencies are multiples of the fundamental frequency, where the amplitudes of the sinusoids, are adaptively modulated using Gammatone filters as a perceptual weighting filter. The sinusoids' phases are also adjusted so as to maximize the perceptual quality. In order to reduce the total bit rate to 1.2 Ops, a new segment coder for spectral information (LSP coefficients) using DP matching is also proposed. The quality of the synthesized speech is considerably improved compared with that of the simple I-PC vocoder, according to MOS and preference tests.\n",

    "Many low bit-rate speech coders represent the spectral envelope by an all-pole digital filter whose coefficients are calculated by a form of linear prediction (LP) analysis. The lower the bit-rate, the more critical will be the accuracy of the spectral analysis for achieving good quality speech. This paper compares four known techniques: a technique based on cubic spline interpolation, DAP, MVDR, and iterative all-pole modelling. First, the accuracy obtained for artificial and real speech spectra is assessed for each technique by calculating the degree of spectral distortion with reference to the spectral envelope sampled at the pitch-harmonics. Then, each technique is used to characterise the spectral amplitudes generated by a 2.4 kb/s multi-band excitation (MBE) coder. Results show that significantly better spectral accuracy is obtained using DAP. However listening tests on MBE encoded speech indicate that the advantage of DAP over the other techniques is not strongly perceptible.\n",

In MLPC analysis a spectrum envelope is estimated on a mel- or bark-frequency scale, so as to improve the spectral resolution in the low frequency band. This analysis is accomplished with about two-fold increase in computation over the standard LPC analysis. Our coding algorithm using MLPC analysis consists of five key parts: time frequency transformation, inverse filtering by MLPC spectrum envelope, power normalization, perceptual weighting estimation, and multi-stage VQ. In subjective experiments, we have investigated the performance of MLPC analysis, through paired comparison tests between the MLPC analysis and the standard LPC one in inverse filtering. In all bit rates, almost all the listeners feel decoding sounds by the MLPC analysis is superior to the LPC one. Especially in low bit rate, there is a great difference between them.\n",

This approach incorporates phonetic information into the structure of Line Spectral Frequency (LSF) codebooks. In prior work vector quantisation (VQ) has been used to quantise stochastic processes. Speech signals can, however, be described in terms of phonetic segments and linguistic rules. A trained LSF codebook, like the phonetic inventory of a language, is a static description of spectral behaviour of speech. As clear relationships exist between phonetic segments and LSFs the structure of an LSF codebook can be analysed in terms of the phonetic segments. The investigation leads to the conclusion that phonetic information can be usefully employed in codebook training in terms of perceptual performance and bit-rate reductions.\n",

    "A method of inter-frame transform coding of Line Spectrum Frequencies (LSF) using the Discrete Wavelet Transform is presented in this paper. Each component of the LSFs (or of their linear transform) is treated separately and is decomposed into a set of subband signals using the nonuniform filter bank. Subband signals are quantized and coded independently. By the appropriate choice of the mother Wavelet, subband signal with the lowest rate comprises most of the LSF waveform energy. Filter bank effectively decorrelates the input signal, enabling more efficient quantization of the subband signals. A suitable weighted Euclidean distance measure in the Wavelet domain is proposed, defining optimal static or dynamic bit allocation of the subband signals. It is shown that the average bit rate for coding of the DCT transformed LSFs can be reduced by 0.9 bits per vector component by using a very simple Wavelet. The total delay due to the inter-frame coding is only 90ms that is acceptable even for a medium bit rate speech coders.\n",

    "This paper describes a source controlled variable bit-rate (SC-VBR) speech coder based on the concept of prototype waveform interpolation. The coder uses a four mode classification : silence, voiced, unvoiced and transition. These modes are detected after the speech has been decomposed into slowly evolving (SEW) and rapidly evolving (REW) waveforms. A voicing activity detection (VAD), the relative level of SEW and REW and the cross-correlation coefficient between characteristic waveform segments are used to make the classification. The encoding of the SEW components is improved using a gender adaptation. In tests using conversational speech, the SC-VBR allows a compression factor of around 3. The VBR coder was evaluated against a fixed rate 4.6kbit/s PWI coder for clean speech and noisy speech and was found to perform better for male speech and for noisy speech.\n",

    "Phonetic vocoding is one of the methods for coding speech below 1000 bit/s. The transmitter stage includes a phone recogniser whose index is transmitted together with prosodic information such as duration, energy and pitch variation. This type of coder does not transmit spectral speaker characteristics and speaker recognisability thus becomes a major problem. In our previous work, we adapted a speaker modification strategy to minimise this problem, modifying a codebook to match the spectral characteristics of the input speaker. This is done at the cost of transmitting the LSP averages computed for vowel and glide phones. This paper presents new codebook generation strategies, with gender dependence and interpolation frames, that lead to better speaker recognisability and speech quality. Relatively to our previous work, some effort was also devoted to deriving more efficient quantization methods for the speaker-specific information , that considerably reduced the average bit rate, without quality degradation.\n",

The proposed HNNs were used within hybrid HMM-ANN models to perform the estimation of posterior probabilities for HMM states.

    "Multi-band automatic speech recognition is a new and exploratory area of speech recognition which has been getting much attention in the research community. It has been shown that multi-band ASR reduces word error in noisy conditions, particularly in the case of narrow band noise. In this work we show that multi-band ASR could be used to improve the speech recognition accuracy of natural numbers for clean speech when the multi-band (MB) information stream is used in addition to the full-band (FB) one. We also observe that a similar combination method significantly reduces the error rate on reverberant speech. Finally, we analyze the error patterns of the full-band and multi-band paradigms to understand why the combination of the two streams is effective.\n",

    "Multinet is a connectionist architecture designed for certain difficult multi-class pattern classification tasks. These are characterised by very large input feature spaces, rendering a monolithic classifier impractical. The architecture consists of a layer with at least one primary 'detector' for each class, followed by a combining net which estimates the posterior probabilities for all classes. Typically primary detectors only input a subset of the input features. Thus the architecture decomposes classification in two ways: by class and by factoring of the input space dimensions. Multinet incorporates the ideas of Modular Neural Networks and Ensembles. In this paper, we investigate the use of Multinet on standard HMM and hybrid HMM-NN systems that we run on the same tasks. The value and potential of the Multinet approach is shown by detailing successive improvements to the Multinet system which are easily obtained because of the modularity of the architecture.\n",

    "The hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used for automatic speech recognition because they have a powerful algorithm used in estimating the model's parameters, and also achieve a high performance. Once a structure of the model is given, the model's parameters are obtained auto- matically by feeding training data. However, there is still an unresolved problem with the HMM, i.e. how to design an optimal HMM structure. In answer to this problem, we proposed the application of a genetic algorithm (GA) to search out such an optimal structure, and we showed this method to be effective for isolated word recognition. However, the test of this method was restricted to discrete HMMs. In this paper, we propose a new application of the GA to the continuous HMM (CHMM) which is thought to be more effective than the discrete HMM. We report the results of our experiment showing the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in automatic speech recognition.\n",

Various fuzzy membership functions on linguistic properties were used to convert exact features extracted from input speech to the fuzzy membership values. The fuzzy membership values were arranged to be new input vector of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The binary desired outputs were used during training. 70 Thai words consist of ten numerals, the others were single-syllable, double-syllable and triple-syllable, 20 words in each group, were used for system evaluation. In order to improve recognition accuracy, number of syllable and tonal level detected were conducted for speech preclassification. The Pi fuzzy membership function provided the best recognition accuracy among other functions; Trapezoidal, and Triangular function. Under an optimal condition, the achieved recognition error rates were 5.6% on dependent test and 6.7% on independent test, which were respectively 3.3% and 3.4% decreasing from the conventional Neural Network system.\n",

With this approach, we are taking the computational effort into account which is used as an additional criterion for assessing the system performance. The main idea of the proposed MNN is the distribution of the complexity for the phoneme classification task on a set of modules. Each of these modules is a single neural network which is characterized by its high degree of specialization. The number of interfaces, and therewith the possibilities for infiltering external acoustic-phonetic knowledge, increases for a modular architecture. Moreover, after the development of a suitable topology for the MNN, each of the modules can be optimized for its specific phoneme recognition task. This is done by detecting and pruning irrelevant input parameters and leads to a more efficient system in terms of memory and computational requirements.\n",

    "This paper describes, how to train Maximum Mutual Information Neural Networks (MMINN) in an efficient way, with a new topology. Large vocabulary speech recognition systems, based on a Hybrid MMI/connectionist HMM combination, have shown good performance on several tasks (RM and WSJ). MMINNs are trained to maximize the mutual information between the index of the winning output neuron (Winner-Takes-All network) and the phonetical class of the corresponding acoustic frame. One major problem of MMI-neural networks is the high computational effort, which is needed for the training of the neural networks. The computational effort is proportional to the input and output size of the neural network and to the number of training samples. This paper shows two approaches, that demonstrate, how these long training times can be reduced with very low or even no loss in recognition accuracy. This is achieved by the use of phonetical knowledge, to build a network topology based on phonetical classes.\n",

    "This paper concerns the identification of Arabic macro-classes and phonetic features by systems using a hierarchy of neural networks. These systems are composed of sub-neural-networks (SNNs) carrying out binary discrimination sub-tasks. Two types of architecture are presented: serial structure of experts and parallel disposition of them. This mixture of experts is composed of typically time delay neural networks using a version of autoregressive backpropagation algorithm (AR-TDNN). These hierarchical configurations are confronted to a monolithic system using standard backpropagation learning procedure. The test database consists of 60 VCV utterances and 50 phrases pronounced by 6 Algerian native speakers. The parallel configuration achieved much fewer error rate (13% vs. 16% and 28%) than other architectures. The parallel mixture of experts is incorporated in a hybrid structure (HMM-SNN) in the order to enhance performances of standard HMMs. Identification results show that 10% reduction of error rate is obtained by the hybrid system.\n",

    "Similarity or likelihood normalization techniques are important for speaker verification systems as they help to alleviate the variations in the speech signals. In the conventional normalization, the a priori probabilities of the cohort speakers are assumed to be equal. From this standpoint, we apply the theory of fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral to combine the likelihood values of the cohort speakers in which the assumption of equal a priori probabilities is relaxed. This approach replaces the conventional normalization term by the fuzzy integral which acts as a non-linear fusion of the similarity measures of an utterance assigned to the cohort speakers. We illustrate the performance of the proposed approach by testing the speaker verification system with both the conventional and the fuzzy algorithms using the commercial speech corpus TI46. The results in terms of the equal error rates show that the speaker verification system using the fuzzy integral is more flexible and more favorable than the conventional normalization method.\n",

Despite its superiority in recognition performance, it still suffers from the problem of over-fitting to the training samples as it is with other learning algorithms. In the present study, a regularization technique is employed to the MCE method to overcome this problem. Feed-forward neural networks are employed as a recognition platform to evaluate the recognition performance of the proposed method. Recognition experiments are conducted on several sorts of datasets.

Experimental results will show that the use of an appropriate duration normalization is very important to obtain good estimates of the phone and word confidences. The different measures are evaluated at the phone and word levels on both isolated word (PHONEBOOK) and continuous speech (BREF) recognition tasks. It will be shown that one of those confidence measures is well suited for utterance verification, and that (as one could expect) confidence measures at the word level perform better than those at the phone level.

In spite of the verification performance, the proposed algorithm complies with the real-time constrains which are mandatory in real applications. We evaluate our method and present recognition results from the long natural number recognition task of a real Data Driven application through the telephone line on a multilingual environment.

Secondly, the search framework uses an efficient two-pass A* search to generate N-best key-phrase candidates and then several sub-syllable level verification functions are properly weighted and used to further improve the recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that the A*-admissible key-phrase spotting with sub-word level utterance method outperforms the baseline methods used in common approaches.\n",

    "Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems show a significant decrease in performance if a users pronunciation differs largely from those observed during system training. This can be considered as the main reason why most commercially available systems recommend - if not enforce - the individual end user to read an enrollment script for the speaker dependent reestimation of acoustic model parameters. Thus, the improvement of recognition rates for dialect speakers is an important issue both with respect to a broader acceptance and a more convenient or natural use of such systems. This paper compares different techniques that aim on a better speaker independent recognition of dialect speech in a large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer. The methods discussed comprise Bayesian adaptation and speaker clustering techniques and deal with both the availability and absence of dialect training material. Results are given for a case study that aims on the improvement of a German speech recognizer for Austrian speakers.\n",

    "Word level confidence measures are of use in many areas of speech recognition. Comparing the hypothesized word score to the score of a 'filler' model has been the most popular confidence measure because it is highly efficient, and does not require a large amount of training data. This paper explores an extension of this technique which also compares the hypothesized word score to the scores of words that are commonly confused for it, while maintaining efficiency and the low demand for training data. The proposed method gives a 39% relative false accept rate reduction over the 'filler'- model baseline, at a false reject rate of 5%.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose to use an utterance length (duration) dependent threshold for rejecting an unknown input utterance with a general speech (garbage) model. A general speech model, comparing with more sophisticated anti-subword models, is a more viable solution to the utterance rejection problem for low-cost applications with stringent storage and computational constraints. However, the rejection performance using such a general model with a fixed, universal rejection threshold is in general worse than the anti-models with higher discriminations. Without adding complexities to the rejection algorithm, we propose to vary the rejection threshold according to the utterance length. The experimental results show that significant improvement in rejection performance can be obtained by using the proposed, length dependent rejection threshold over a fixed threshold. We investigate utterance rejection in a command phrase recognition task. The equal error rate, a good figure of merit for calibrating the performance of utterance verification algorithms, is reduced by almost 23% when the proposed length dependent threshold is used.\n",

    "This paper presents a Bayesian constrained frequency warping technique. The Bayesian approach provides for inclusion of the prior information of the frequency warping parameter and for adjusting the search range in order to obtain the best warping factor dependent on HMMs. We introduce novel frequency warping (FWP) HMMs which are different warped versions of HMMs. Instead of frequency warping of the input speech we warp the spectrum of the HMMs. This is equivalent to HMMs which have both time and frequency warping capabilities. Experimentally FWP HMMs outperform the conventional constrained frequency warping approach. Furthermore, the best warping factor is estimated in two stages, a coarse stage followed by a fine stage. This method efficiently gauges the optimal warping factor and normalises the FWP HMMs.\n",

    "In this paper, we describe our effort in developing new method of false alarm rejection for keyword spotting type of speech recognition system that we have developed about a year ago. This false alarm rejection uses prosodic similarities, and works as posterior rescore basis. In keyword spotting, there is always false alarm problem. Here, we propose a technique to reject those false alarms using prosodic features. In Japanese, prosodic information is expressed in intonation form, while may of other languages is using stress accents. Therefore, it is easy to calculate prosodic information using fundamental frequency, so called F0, in our language. In our new keyword spotting engine, we get result by combining two scores. One is phonetic score calculated by front engine, and the other is pitch score calculated by post engine described in this paper. We have accomplished 13points improvement on keyword recognition accuracy using this method.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a Predictive Speaker Adaptation technique (PSA) in which speaker dependent HMM(SD-HMM) for a new speaker is predicted using adaptation utterances and a speaker independent HMM(SI-HMM). The method requires a prior training in order to estimate the parameters of the prediction function. For this purpose, we first prepare many speaker's fully trained SD-HMMs and their adaptation utterances(same for all speakers). In addition many speaker-specific BW-HMMs are built from the SI-HMM by means of Baum-Welch re-estimation on the adaptation utterances. The model-pair SD-HMM and BW-HMM for each speaker is used as training example for the input and output of the prediction function to find the speaker-independent prediction parameters. During adaptation, estimation of the new speaker's SD-HMM is carried out from his BW-HMM with the predetermined parameters. 60,000-word recognition experiments reported a word error-rate reduction of 16% when only 10 adaptation words were used.\n",

As for the language model, the problem produced, in the case of unlimited-vocabulary continuous-speech recognition, by the lack of information on new words in the training corpus is solved through the use of the limited information we gathered on new words. The results obtained in general-task keyword spotting as well as unlimited-vocabulary continuous-speech recognition demonstrate the efficiency of the choice of a one-syllable transcription rather than a one-phoneme one. As for the results in unlimited-vocabulary continuous-speech recognition, the language model using information from words of frequency one is demonstrated to be a new promising method of determination of a language model for new words.\n",

    "Phonetic baseforms are the basic recognition units in most speech recognition systems. These baseforms are usually determined by linguists once a vocabulary is chosen and not modified thereafter. However, several applications, such as name dialing, require the user be able to add new words to the vocabulary. These new words are often names, or task-specific jargon, that have user-specific pronunciations. This paper describes a novel method for generating phonetic transcriptions (baseforms) of words based on acoustic evidence alone. It does not require any prior acoustic representation of the new word, is vocabulary independent, and uses phonological rules in a post processing stage to enhance the quality of the baseforms thus produced. Our experiments demonstrate the high decoding accuracies obtained when baseforms deduced using this approach are incorporated into our speech recognizer. Our experiments also compare the use of acoustic models that are trained on task-specific data with models trained for a general purpose ( to do digit, names, large vocabulary recognition, etc.), for generating phonetic transcriptions.\n",

    "In this paper, we present a word counting method that enables speech recognition systems to perform reliable barge-in detection and also make a fast and accurate determination of end of speech. This is achieved by examining partial recognition hypotheses and imposing certain \"word stability\" criteria. Typically, a voice activity detector is used for both barge-in detection and end of speech determination. We propose augmenting the voice activity detector with this more reliable recognition-based method. Experimental results for a connected digit task show that this approach is more robust for supporting barge-in since it is less prone to interrupting the announcement when extraneous speech input is encountered. Also, by using the early endpoint decision criterion, average response times are sped up 75% for this connected digit task.\n",

    "In Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN) a linear or nonlinear frequency transformation compensates for different vocal tract lengths. Finding good estimates for the speaker specific warp parameters is a critical issue. Despite good results using the Maximum Likelihood criterion to find parameters for a linear warping, there are concerns using this method. We searched for a new criterion that enhances the interclass separability in addition to optimizing the distribution of each phonetic class. Using such a criterion Linear Discriminant Analysis determines a linear transformation in a lower dimensional space. For VTLN, we keep the dimension constant and warp the training samples of each speaker such that the Linear Discriminant is optimized. Although that criterion depends on all training samples of all speakers it can iteratively provide speaker specific warp factors. We discuss how this approach can be applied in speech recognition and present first results on two different recognition tasks.\n",

Since the prosodic information is a very special and important feature for Mandarin speech, we integrate the prosodic information into keyword verification. For multi-keyword detection, we define a keyword relation and a weighting function for reasonable keyword combinations. In the keyword recognizer, 94 INITIAL and 38 FINAL context-dependent Hidden Markov Models (HMM's) are used to construct the phonetic recognizer. For prosodic verification, a total of 175 context-dependent HMM's and five anti-prosodic HMM's are used. In this system, 1275 faculty names and department names are selected as the keywords. Using a test set of 3595 conversional speech utterance from 37 speakers (21 male, 16 female), the proposed fuzzy search algorithm and prosodic verification can reduce the error rate from 17.64% to 11.29% for multiple keywords embedded in non-keyword speech.\n",

    "Sequential models of word perception assigned a very special role to word onsets. This accounted in a natural way for evidence that lexical access is easier from word beginnings than from word endings, a property speech perception shares with reading. Sequential models badly failed on other scores, however. More recent competition models seem to give equal weight to stimulus information, independent of position within the word. The present word recognition experiment aimed at testing the hypothesis that, other things being equal, mismatches are more damaging to word perception at onsets than at offsets of embedded words, both in speech perception and in reading. Results show that word recognition is quite good in all conditions, even when word onsets are mutilated, and mis-timed, thus lending support to competition models. Yet, the results also show that lexical access is modulated by some early-to-late or left-to-right component, as if human word perception displays a mixture of sequential and competition processing.\n",

    "The present paper focuses on the segmentation of two-word phrases containing two closely competing lexical hypotheses. It is hypothesized that the bottom-up information, which also includes a mechanism called the Possible-Word Constraint, is explored first in segmenting these phrases. Non-sensory sentential information influences this process at a later stage and only shows an effect if the bottom-up information does not lead to one dominating interpretation. The results of the present experiment show that beside the acoustic information listeners can and do use contextual information at a relatively early moment, at which the two possible segmentations are both still active and the bottom-up information has not yet suppressed the acoustically inconsistent interpretation. This effect became apparent, since disambiguating bottom-up information arrived relatively late in the stimulus phrases. Hence, it was concluded that both sensory and non-sensory information are employed to affect activation levels of competing lexical hypotheses at an early moment.\n",

    "Words in connected speech are often assimilated to subsequent words. Some property of that upcoming word may then be determined in advance; these advance assimilatory cues may facilitate perception of that word. A gating experiment was conducted in Dutch, studying anticipatory voice assimilation between plosives, in 24 two-word combinations. In Dutch, voicing in a word-final plosive can only be caused by anticipatory assimilation to the next, voiced initial plosive, e.g. \"rie[db]lint\". Voiced and unvoiced variants of final and initial plosives were cross-spliced. Responses for assimilated, voiced-final stimuli show a strong bias to voiced-initial responses, as predicted. Even at longer gates in the hybrid condition \"rie[dp]lint\", after hearing the unvoiced initial plosive, listeners often came up with a voiced-initial response, with high confidence. Hence, advance phonological 'voiced-initial' cues were often stronger than acoustic 'unvoiced-initial' cues. These gating results suggest that listeners use advance assimilatory cues in word perception.\n",

While previous studies have examined the effects of carefully produced or electronically edited reductions, we present two experiments which compare cross-modal repetition priming for lexical decisions by more reduced spontaneous forms and less reduced read forms of the same words uttered by the same speakers in the same phrases. Though less priming is found for the more reduced spontaneous tokens, both versions of words produce significant priming effects, whether the majority of stimuli are taken from spontaneous speech (Experiment 1) or from read speech (Experiment 2). Priming is more robust if tokens themselves contain the context licensing reduction.\n",

    "This paper reports how rapid fluctuations of fundamental frequencies in continuously uttered vowels influence vowel quality and shows that vowel qualities with various fundamental frequency fluctuations can be discriminated perceptually. For this purpose, electroglottographs (EGGs) of vowels uttered by nine males were obtained using Laryngograph, and fundamental frequencies with rapid fluctuations were estimated from them. Analyzing forty-five estimated fundamental frequencies, they can be classified into four groups. Moreover, psychoacoustic experiments, with five subjects, evaluating voice quality by multidimensional scaling (MDS) showed that voice quality of the synthesized speech using the fundamental frequencies of the groups was completely discriminable and there was a distinctive frequency band of fundamental frequency fluctuation for specifying each group perceptually.\n",

    "A familiarity database was developed for about 80,000 Japanese words of which familiarity scores were rated by 32 Japanese adults using a 7-point scale in auditory, visual, and audio-visual modalities. Auditory, visual, and audio-visual stimulus words were selected from the database according to their word familiarity for size estimation of the mental lexicon. Sixty Japanese adults participated in a two-alternative forced-choice task (Know-Don't know) for the stimulus words. The size of the mental lexicon was estimated as the number of words of which familiarity is above a particular word corresponding to 50% point on the fitted logistic curve to \"know\"-response probability of the stimulus words. The estimated size was about 68,000 for auditory words, and about 66,000 both for visual and audio-visual words when homophones and homographs were included. The results suggest that very small difference in the mental lexicon size among modalities.\n",

    "Clear speech is characterised by longer segmental durations and less target undershoot which results in more extreme spectral features. This paper deals with the clarity of vowels produced in spontaneous speech in a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues. We present an automatic technique for measuring vowel clarity on the basis of a vowel's spectral characteristics. This technique was evaluated using a perceptual test. Subjects rated the 'goodness' of vowels with different spectral characteristics with controlled duration and amplitude and these results were compared with an automatic rating. Results indicated that although agreement between subjects and the automatic measurement was poor it was as poor as the agreement between subjects. On the basis of these results we address the following questions: 1. Can subjects reliably judge the clarity of vowels excerpted from spontaneous speech without duration cues? 2. Can a statistical model reliably predict the subjects' response to such vowels?\n",

    "In this paper, we study the influence of the vocalic context on the perception and automatic recognition of stops. In a previous perception experiment [1] using conflicting cues stimuli, we have shown that place of articulation cued by formant transitions may be overwritten by the place cued by the burst. This effect is inversely proportional to the vowel aperture. Here we give special attention to /i/ context where nor burst, nor formant transitions seem to carry rich information on place of articulation. We present here automatic recognition experiments that confirm perception results. Taking into account both segments increase identification rates, early fusion of segmental cues performs best and most errors come from the front unrounded vocalic context. We introduce the \"burst characteristic frequency\" (BF) that palliates for the poor discriminative power of the traditional cues in the front context. Moreover we present perception results showing the perceptual relevance of BF.\n",

    "With synthetic stimuli copied from natural vowels and including up to five formants, we investigated some transformations of the perceived identity of vowels by means of modifications of formant amplitude levels. Synthetic stimuli were generated by means of a new method of copy synthesis. With stimuli copied from /u/ we found that, despite the presence of F2, it is possible to transform the timbre of /u/ into that of a front vowel only by raising the amplitude level of F3 and higher formants. We also analysed how the timbre of the vowels /i/ and /y/ changed as a function of the level of F2, F3 and F4, and showed how sensitive was the timbre of the vowel /i/ to the decrease of the level of F3 and F4. Such transformations, realized with stimuli very close to natural vowels, reinforce the importance of formant amplitude levels in some vocalic distinctions.\n",

    "In a tone language, such as Cantonese, both segmental and tonal distinctions between words are pervasive. However, previous work in Cantonese has demonstrated that in speeded-response tasks, tone is more likely to be misprocessed than is segmental structure. The present study examined whether this tone disadvantage would also hold after the initial auditory processing of a syllable had been done. Cantonese listeners were asked to perform same-different judgments on two sequentially presented open syllables along a specific dimension (i.e., onset, rime, tone, or the whole syllable) according to an instruction which was visually presented at the acoustic offset of the second syllable. Manipulating whether the difference between two syllables was in onset, rime, or tone resulted in equally robust effects across the various decision tasks on performance, indicating that tone functions as effectively as segmental structure in spoken-word processing once the related information of a syllable is encoded.\n",

Previous studies revealed that fricative noises of both phonemes are perceptually similar, auditory identification being significantly dependent on contextual effects: /f/ in the /u/ context is well identified (about 85% correct identification rate), while in the /e/ context identification is much lower (about 60%). Identification of /th/ is low for every vocalic context (about 60%). These effects were identical for both Hypo and Hyper forms of speech. The objective of this paper is to determine which acoustic properties of /f/ in the /u/ context make it a well defined phoneme for the two different forms of speech. We conclude that the cues for the identification of the isolated fricative noise of /f/ seem to be in the low frequency region of the spectrum.\n",

Perceptual tests were carried out to assess the recognition of vowels in fricative context, in two conditions: 1) Isolated vowel; 2) Fricative noise + vowel. Analysis of results show that adding the fricative noise improves the recognition of the vowel, while the acoustic analysis reveal that the distribution of the vowels is affected by fricative context. A possible explanation for this improvement, i.e. the coarticulatory influence of the vowel on the fricative, was investigated. The results indicate that coarticulation cannot explain that improvement, since only 7.7% of the cases which improve when the fricative is added, show a clear influence of the vowel on the fricative.\n",

Listeners perceive voiced fricatives as a voiced phoneme with different manner of articulation and similar place of articulation or as its voiceless counterpart, depending on whether vocal-fold vibration extends over the whole obstruent interval or not.

The vowel onset/offset and consonant constriction/occlusion regions were selectively amplified and stimuli were presented to listeners in a background of noise (0 dB SNR). Enhanced tokens from all speakers were significantly more intelligible than natural tokens and the improvement was greater for the initially least intelligible speakers. Speech material for two speakers was then presented to Japanese and Spanish learners of English and controls. For all groups, the enhanced consonants were more intelligible. Error patterns were related to the 'distance' between the consonantal systems of the listeners' L1 and L2.

Our investigation is adopted from similar studies of tones in Mandarin speech. As opposed to Mandarin tones that can be perceived with little difficulty the seven Taiwanese tones have a more subtle structure and are consequently harder to perceive successfully. The experimental results in this paper allow us to quantify these perceptual boundaries. The experiments consisted of a perception test involving over 150 Taiwanese subjects where the task involved identifying the tone of the words played back in a random sequence. The stimuli consisted of a set of tone pairs and a selection of intermediate tone words obtained by linearly interpolating between the words of the tone pairs.\n",

    "To establish a perceptually valid rule for the durational control of synthetic speech, it is necessary to know the degree to which a given temporal error or distortion is acceptable to human listeners. Two perceptual experiments were conducted to estimate the acceptability of modifications in either vocalic or consonantal durations as a function of two attributes of the modified portions, i.e., the phonetic quality and the original (unmodified) duration. The results showed that the listeners' acceptable modification ranges were narrowest for vowels, and widest for voiceless fricatives and silent closures, with nasals in between. They were also narrower for those portions with shorter base durations. The effect of the original duration was larger for the vowel stimuli than for the voiceless fricative stimuli. The perceptual mechanism mediating these results is discussed with regard to the dependency of the listeners' temporal sensitivity on the stimulus loudness and base duration.

In addition to these, subjects were presented with the same tokens reconstructed from their minimum phase decomposition such that they have the same long-term power spectrum as their original counterparts, but with differing internal dynamic spectral detail. Subjects' results from this experiment were then modelled with logistic regression analysis using mel cepstral coefficients with and without dynamic spectral information encoded in order to demonstrate the effect that reduced temporal information has in the context of automatic classification. Preliminary results from this experiment show that some dynamic spectral detail is used by listeners even for very short stimuli. We conclude that models of speech perception must take spectral variation over very short time frames into account.\n",

As for French subjects in the earlier study, the miss rates showed an effect of syllabic segmentation, suggesting that the Japanese Brazilians segmented Japanese into syllables. The second experiment investigated phonological units in phonological awareness, using a mid-chunk-unit search task in which subjects were asked to identify the middle unit within a word. 96% of the mid-chunk unit choices were syllable-based.

    "Speakers frequently retrace one or more words when continuing after a break in fluency. Syntactic principles constrain the points from which speakers retrace; however syntactic principles do not provide predictions about the relative usage of different allowable retrace points. Such predictions are useful for automatic processing of repairs in speech technology, particularly if they use information readily available to a speech recognizer. We propose a quantitative model that predicts the overall distribution of retrace lengths in a large corpus of spontaneous speech, based only on word position. The model has two components: (1) a constant, position-independent probability for extending a retrace by one more word; and (2) a position-dependent probability to \"skip\" to the beginning of the sentence. Results have implications for modeling repairs in speech applications and constrain explanatory models in psycholinguistics.\n",

    "This paper investigates the prosodic relevance of a pause which, along with other prosodic parameters, served to indicate an Intonational Phrase (IPh) boundary. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while subjects listened to both intact and altered German Early and Late Closure (EC/LC) sentences. The EC sentences were prosodically highly accepted and well comprehended even when the original pause at the boundary position was removed. Furthermore, a reversed garden-path (initial EC preference in LC sentences) was successfully induced by a false IPh boundary irrespective of whether the pause was present or not. The ERP patterns disclosed the on-line processing of simple and garden-path sentences in more detail. The data clearly demonstrate that in the presence of other prosodic parameters pause insertion is a completely dispensable cue for boundary marking. The ERP technique proved to be superior to behavioral on-line measures as data collection does not interrupt speech presentation.\n",

In a phoneme monitoring task, we used Dutch carrier words that start in their citation form with a reduced vowel (denoted as @), but which can also be produced with an unreduced vowel. For example, a word such as frequent (meaning frequent) can be pronounced as fr@QUENT or freQUENT. We examined whether mis-stressing these words had an effect on the activation of their lexical representation. Twenty subjects detected a target phoneme (e.g., the 't') in fr@QUENT, freQUENT, FR@quent, or FREquent; stress denoted in capitals. Results showed that target phonemes in words were reacted faster than in pseudowords, but neither stress, nor the nature of the vowel had an effect on the size of lexical effect. This confirms that stress is not part of the lexical input representation.\n",

    "The effect of word level prominence on detection speed of word boundaries in Finnish was investigated in two word spotting experiments. The results showed that the perceived stress was not a function of the fundamental frequency (F0) difference between the preceding syllable and the first syllable of the target word. Given the fast response times, the results suggest that subjects perceived in both experiments the first syllable of the target as stressed. This seems to indicate that when words are recognized in continuous speech the acoustic cues in the F0 contour signaling prominence may not be computed relative to the prominence of neighboring syllables. Instead, we hypothesize that subjects may be sensitive to a local pitch movement indicating change in the F0 slope.\n",

A variety of empirical and theoretical research findings are described in order to inform and hopefully to provide a more critical look at this pervasive concept.

In previous experiments /w/ and /j/ were combined with the vowels /i/ and /a/ to form the four syllables /wi/, /wa, /ji/ and /ja/. It was found that if both the vowels and their pitches differed the consonants could be identified by some of the listeners part of the time. The effect of fundamental frequency on perception has now been explored. Each pair of syllables had different consonants and different vowels but one syllable had a pitch of 100 Hz whilst the other had a pitch of between 100 and 200 Hz. It was found that some syllables were perceived like vowels. Effects one syllable of the pair leading the other have also been systematically explored.\n",

    "In the production of Swedish, vowel quantity is known to be realized in the vowel, but also affects duration of a postvocalic consonant. The goal of this study is to examine the use of postvocalic consonant duration as a perceptual cue to vowel quantity. Listeners' responses and reaction times were recorded for synthesized materials in which the vowel spectra and duration were kept constant and the postvocalic consonant duration was adjusted. Results show no indication that listeners actively used the duration of a postvocalic consonant to identify vowel quantity. These findings suggest that adjustments in postvocalic consonant duration in Swedish productions may be temporal artifacts of the preceding vowel quantity rather than reflecting linguistically relevant information.\n",

    "The phoneme detection task is widely used in spoken word recognition research. Alphabetically literate participants, however, are more used to explicit representations of letters than of phonemes. The present study explored whether phoneme detection is sensitive to how target phonemes are, or may be, orthographically realised. Listeners detected the target sounds [b,m,t,f,s,k] in word-initial position in sequences of isolated English words. Response times were faster to the targets [b,m,t], which have consistent word-initial spelling, than to the targets [f,s,k], which are inconsistently spelled, but only when listeners' attention was drawn to spelling by the presence in the experiment of many irregularly spelled fillers. Within the inconsistent targets [f,s,k], there was no significant difference between responses to targets in words with majority and minority spellings. We conclude that performance in the phoneme detection task is not necessarily sensitive to orthographic effects, but that salient orthographic manipulation can induce such sensitivity.\n",

    "This study is part of a cross-linguistic investigation of phonological units, with emphasis on such ostensive universals as the segment (C or V), the syllable (e.g., CVC), and the rime (VC). Prior work has indicated that speakers of some languages (e.g., Chinese) may not segment words into units smaller than the whole syllable, while in other languages (e.g., Korean and Japanese) units called the body (CV) or the mora may supplant the rime. However, the native speakers tested so far were all relatively well educated, literate, and often bilingual. Thus they were all exposed to writing systems that might have influenced their performance. Since knowledge of orthography has not been controlled in previous studies, in the present research we will test speakers of English and Korean who have not been subjected to the influence of spelling. These include preliterate children, who are the focus of the study.\n",

    "Results of a word-spotting experiment are presented in which Dutch listeners tried to spot different types of bisyllabic Dutch words embedded in different types of nonsense contexts. Embedded verbs were not reliably harder to spot than embedded nouns; this suggests that nouns and verbs are recognised via the same basic processes. Iambic words were no harder to spot than trochaic words, suggesting that trochaic words are not in principle easier to recognise than iambic words. Words were harder to spot in consonantal contexts (i.e., contexts which themselves could not be words) than in longer contexts which contained at least one vowel (i.e., contexts which, though not words, were possible words of Dutch). A control experiment showed that this difference was not due to acoustic differences between the words in each context. The results support the claim that spoken-word recognition is sensitive to the viability of sound sequences as possible words.\n",

We studied whether these VC formant patterns may nevertheless contain sufficient cues to differentiate the place or whether they also require the cues at the stop release. Twenty-one listeners were asked to identify the final stop in syllables with varying place and preceding vowel, with and without the final stop release. There were 86% correct judgments of place with the stop releases but 63% without. In the gated condition the responses showed a marked asymmetry: stops normally having weak bursts (labial and dental) were most often correct but were also the favored erroneous response for the other stops. The results further suggest a qualification to Steriade's claim that retroflex stop's VC place cues are more robust than release: this may be true after low vowels but is not true after /i/.\n",

    "In previous experiments with Dutch, French and Swedish listeners, it was shown that the location in the syllable of the onset of a rising or falling pitch movement is critical for the perception of accentuation. As the onset of the pitch movement is shifted through the syllable, there is a point at which the percept of accentuation shifts from one syllable to the next. This point is termed the accentuation boundary. It has also been proposed that in certain positions, the percept of accentuation conflicts with the percept of phrasing. An experiment with Swedish listeners was carried out using the same stimuli as used for the accentuation study, but now the task was to determine the phrasing of the syllables. The results indicate that perceptual phrase boundaries can be determined in the same way as accentuation boundaries. Differences in the locations of the boundaries can be interpreted in terms of strengths of tonal cues for accentuation and phrasing.\n",

    "Traditional models of speech assume that a detailed analysis of the acoustic spectrum is essential for understanding spoken language. The validity of this assumption was tested by partitioning the spectrum of spoken sentences into 1/3-octave channels (\"slits\") and measuring the intelligibility associated with each channel presented alone and in concert with the others. Four spectral channels, distributed over the speech-audio range (0.3 - 6 kHz) are sufficient for human listeners to decode sentential material with nearly 90% accuracy, although more than 70% of the spectrum is missing. Word recognition often remains relatively high (60-83%) when just two or three channels are presented concurrently, even though the intelligibility of these same slits, presented in isolation, is less than 9%. Such data suggest that intelligibility is derived from a compound \"image\" of the modulation spectrum distributed across the frequency spectrum. Because intelligibility seriously degrades when slits are desynchronized by more than 25 ms, this image is probably derived from both the amplitude and phase components of the modulation spectrum.\n",

    "Linguistic context is known to influence speech perception abilities in adults with normal hearing. Recent reports question the importance of context for adults with a severe-to-profound hearing impairment. The severe reduction and distortion in acoustic input may result in the listener perceiving insufficient acoustic-phonetic cues to allow access to higher level linguistic processing. To investigate this further, a detailed study of the speech recognition of adults with a severe-to-profound hearing impairment (N=34) was undertaken. A series of aided speech recognition tasks, sequentially examined the different levels of processing in the speech perception chain. The investigation concluded that the effects of severe-to-profound hearing impairment did not reduce the listener's ability to take advantage of contextual cues. There was, however, wide variability between participants in the utilisation of contextual processing. This indicates that to estimate \"real-life\" speech perception skills, an evaluation of contextual processing ability is required.\n",

Since it is likely that the basis of any phoneme awareness in children is laid already in their first year of life, it is of great importance to follow the perceptual development of children at risk of dyslexia from birth onwards. In order to investigate the nature and origin of the perceptual deficit dyslexic people are afflicted with, a number of auditory tests are designed. The various steps in the development of the definite set of auditory tests, to be used in the actual research program, the rationale underlying these various steps, and first results of the pilot tests are described in the present paper.\n",

    "This paper presents an acoustic investigation of vowel production in reading, naming and repetition tasks by LM, a man with non-fluent progressive aphasia. Plots in the F1/F2 plane showing the centroids of the acoustic targets of [i: E A V O u:] and the formant trajectories of [ai ei ou] demonstrate that LM achieved greater differentiation of targets in reading than in naming or repetition, and that the vowel space for repetition was distorted relative to that of the other two tasks. An earlier study of LM's speech argued that phonological information available from the stimuli in reading and repetition tasks facilitated the activation of stored phonological representations for speech production (Croot, Patterson & Hodges, 1988); the present study suggests that articulatory processing is also facilitated directly or indirectly by the availability of phonological information.\n",

    "Traditionally, perceptual judgement of speech disorders by clinicians has been a cornerstone of speech language pathology. Increasingly, it is being argued that acoustic speech analysis should supplement aural perception in the clinic. For successful clinical application of speech technology, experts in acoustic analysis generally agree that a working knowledge of acoustic phonetics, digital signal processing and the literature on the acoustic characteristics of speech disorders are required. However, it is not necessarily compellingly obvious to clinicians. This paper examines the issues by examining how the various components fit into the clinical picture. It examines when and how speech technology can be used by clinicians, arguing that clinicians need to be able to do much more than just operate the system. The paper concludes that successful integration of speech technology into clinical environments provides an opportunity to for technologists and clinicians to work together to produce effective speech technology for clinical applications.\n",

    "GALAXY is a client-server architecture for accessing on-line information using spoken dialogue which was first introduced at ICSLP-94. It has served as the testbed for developing human language technologies for our group for several years. Recently, we have initiated a significant redesign of its architecture to enable many researchers to develop their own applications, using either exclusively their own servers or intermixing them with servers developed by others. This redesign was done in part due to the fact that GALAXY has been designated as the prototype reference architecture for the new DARPA Communicator Program. The new architecture, GALAXY-II, makes use of a scripting language for flow control to provide flexible interaction among the servers, and a set of libraries to support rapid prototyping of new servers. In this paper, we describe the new architecture in some detail, and report on the current status of its development.\n",

    "This paper explores some issues in designing conversational systems with integrated higher level constraints. We experiment with a configuration that combines a context-dependent acoustic front-end, using MIT's SUMMIT recognizer, with ANGIE, a hierarchical framework that models word substructure and phonological processes, and with TINA, a trainable probabilistic natural language (NL) model. Working in the Jupiter weather domain, we develop a computationally tractable system which incorporates higher level linguistic, prosodic and phonological constraints together in the second of a two-pass strategy. Experiments are evaluated using a new understanding performance metric, and the new integrated system achieves up to 17.1% relative reduction in understanding error and 15.4% reduction in word error. In addition, we investigate the possibilities of a two-pass system which relies on the first stage for pruning based on syllable-level constraint, and applies linguistic and prosodic knowledge largely at the second stage.\n",

    "In this paper, we investigate a number of robust indexing and retrieval methods in an effort to improve spoken document retrieval performance in the presence of speech recognition errors. In particular, we examine expanding the original query representation to include confusible terms; developing a new document-query retrieval measure based on approximate matching that is less sensitive to recognition errors; expanding the document representation to include multiple recognition hypotheses; modifying the original query using automatic relevance feedback to include new terms found in the top ranked documents; and combining information from multiple subword unit representations. We study the different methods individually and then explore the effects of combining them. Experiments on radio broadcast news data show that using a combination of these methods can improve retrieval performance by over 20%.\n",

    "Most work on sense disambiguation presumes that one knows beforehand --- e.g. from a thesaurus --- a set of polysemous terms. But published lists invariably give only partial coverage. For example, the English word tan has several obvious senses, but one may overlook the abbreviation for tangent. In this paper, we present an algorithm for identifying interesting polysemous terms and measuring their degree of polysemy, given an unlabeled corpus. The algorithm involves: (i) collecting all terms within a k-term window of the target term; (ii) computing the inter-term distances of the contextual terms, and reducing the multi-dimensional distance space to two dimensions using standard methods; (iii) converting the two-dimensional representation into radial coordinates and using isotonic/antitonic regression to compute the degree to which the distribution deviates from a single-peak model. The amount of deviation is the proposed polysemy index.\n",

Besides allowing an efficient exploitation of parallelism, any-time capability is provided since after each iteration step a (sub-)optimal solution is always available. We apply this approach to a real-world task, which is a dialog system able to answer queries about the German train timetable. In order to speed up the search for the best interpretation of an utterance we make use of statistical methods, e.g. neural networks, n-grams, and classification trees, which are trained on application relevant utterances collected over the public telephone network.

    "We have proposed a method of concept-driven semantic interpretation based on general semantic knowledge of conceptual dependency. In our approach, a concept is a unit of semantic interpretation and an utterance is regarded as a sequence of concepts that convey an intention. However, a considerable number of accepted results were not syntactically meaningful. This is because the order in which linguistic features occurred in the sequence of concepts was not taken into account in constructing the whole meaning from the concepts: only semantic constraint was used to attain linguistic robustness. Therefore, we introduce a statistical language model which calculates the plausibility of a sequence of concepts from the points of view of the order in which shallow linguistic features occur. Experimental results of speech understanding for 1000-word-vocabulary spontaneous speech show that the proposed method significantly improves the system performance.\n",

    "In a limited domain task (e.g. airline reservation, database retrieval, etc) many robust understanding systems, designed for both speech and text input, have been implemented [1][3][5][6][10] based on the Stochastic Conceptual Finite-State paradigm (Semantic Network) or CHRONUS paradigm [11] (Conceptual Hidden Representation of Natural Unconstrained Speech), which establishes relations between conceptual entities through a probabilistic graph-like structure. The use of this kind of grammar to model semantic information presents limitations, which have been analysed during the implementation of a flexible architecture for a robust information retrieval system, based on the same paradigm [1]. We have tried to solve some of them by integrating a set of conceptual probabilistic and non-probabilistic grammars, which allow certain complexity in the functionality of the application, such as applying non-SQL functions to the results of SQL queries in order to retrieve information not explicitly included in the database, translating certain natural spoken sentences (that would produce difficult embedded queries and therefore more natural queries) without so many restrictions in the relative position of inter-concept relationship.\n",

The system allows users to switch languages seamlessly in a single session without requiring any switch in the speech recognition system. Context-dependence is maintained across utterances, even when the user changes languages. Towards this end we have begun building a universal speech recognizer for English and French languages. We experiment with a common phonology for both French and English with a novel mechanism to handle language dependent variations. Our best results so far show about 5% relative performance degradation for English relative to a unilingual English system and a 9% relative degradation in French relative to a unilingual French system. The NLU system uses the same statistical understanding algorithms for each language, making system development, maintenance and portability vastly superior to systems built customly for each language.\n",

    "The robust estimation of language models for new applications of spoken dialogue systems often suffers from a lack of available training material. An alternative to training is to adapt initial language models to a new task by exploiting material from recognition. We investigate different methods for online-adaptation of language models. Apart from supervised and unsupervised adaptation, we look at two refined approaches: the first allows multiple hypotheses from N-best lists for adaptation and the second uses confidence measures to reject unreliably recognized sentences. We apply adaptation both to the language model used in the recognizer to focus the beam search and to the stochastic language understanding grammar. It turns out that the understanding grammar can be improved quite significantly using N-best lists or confidence measures, whereas unsupervised adaptation may even result in a deterioration of the system. The language model used in the recognizer is also improved very satisfactory.\n",

Each candidate phrase has three associated probability distributions of : following contexts, preceding contexts, and associated semantic actions. The similarity between candidate phrases is measured by applying the Kullback-Leibler distance to these three probability distributions. Candidate phrases that are close in all three distances are clustered into a Fragment. Salient sequences of these Fragments are then automatically acquired, and exploited by a spoken language understanding to classify calls in AT&T's ``How May I Help You?'' task.

Routing behavior is trained from a corpus of transcribed and hand-routed calls and then carried out using vector-based information retrieval techniques. Terms consist of sequences of morphologically reduced content words. Documents representing routing destinations consist of weighted term frequencies derived from calls to that destination in the training corpus. In this paper, we evaluate our approach in the context of a large financial services call center with thousands of possible customer activities and dozens of routing destinations. We evaluate the system's performance on ambiguous and unambiguous calls when given either accurate transcriptions or fairly noisy real-time speech recognizer output. We conclude that in a highly complex call center, our system performs at roughly the same level of accuracy as human operators.\n",

    "One approach to spoken language understanding converts a transcribed utterance into a semantic representation, which is then interpreted to produce a response. This can be accomplished with conventional parsing technology given a syntactic grammar and semantic composition rules. However, constructing such a grammar can be difficult and time-consuming. An alternative approach is to learn the rules from translated examples. This eliminates the need for knowledge engineering but requires the collection and annotation of the examples, which can be as difficult. This research investigates using semantic information to learn syntax automatically. After describing a semantic parsing mechanism for parsing utterances based on meaning, we illustrate a grammar induction technique which uses semantic parsing's results to create syntactic rules. We also present experiments which use these rules in syntactic parsing experiments in two domains. The learned grammar covers 98% of semantically-valid utterances in its original domain and 85% in a different domain.\n",

    "The model presented here for parsing spoken German offers a way to proceed incrementally discontinuous constructions. Typical constructions in task oriented dialogs are Extrapositions to the right. These are defined as syntactical constructions where a constituent is extraposed in the Nachfeld. Basing on the assumption that the extraposed constituent is not part of the source sentence the model works by coordinating the syntactical information given by the source sentence and the extraposed constituent to complete the extaposed constituent to a whole sentence. Therefore, the standard LR(1)-parser is extended by two additional actions. The parsing strategy works by deriving the first part of the construction until the extraposed constituent is reached. The both new actions enable the parser to proceed further by taking the syntactical information of the source sentence to complete the extraposed constituent to a sentence of its own. The repeated use of these actions guarantees that every intended reading will be performed.\n",

    "It has been relatively difficult to develop natural language parsers for spoken dialog systems, not only because of the possible recognition errors, pauses, hesitations, out-of-vocabulary words, and the grammatically incorrect sentence structures, but because of the great efforts required to develop a general enough grammar with satisfactory coverage and flexibility to handle different applications. In this paper, a new hierarchical graph-based search scheme with layered structure is presented, which is shown to provide more robust and flexible spontaneous speech understanding for spoken dialog systems.\n",

    "ABSTRACT This paper presents an approach to extraction of dialog acts and topics from utterances in a spoken dialog system. Two knowledge sources are used to describe the dialog history. One is a transition network of dialog acts and the other is a tree of topics which might appear in domain communications. Dialog acts and topics are extracted through bottom-up and top-down analyses. Bottom-up candidates are decided by applying a set of specially designed rules to the semantic representation of an utterance, and top-down candidates by using the current state of the dialog history. The logical ANDs between bottom-up and top-down candidates are taken to decide the dialog act and topic of an utterance. This method was examined with a corpus of fourteen dialogs including 335 utterances. Correct extraction rates were 85% for the topic and 82% for the dialog act.\n",

    "Maximum entropy / minimum divergence modeling is a powerful technique for constructing probability models, which has been applied to a variety of problems in natural language processing. A maximum entropy / minimum divergence (MEMD) model is built from a base model, and a set of feature functions, also called simply features, whose empirical expectations on some training corpus are known. A fundamental difficulty with this technique is that while there are typically millions of features that could be incorporated into a given model, in general it is not computationally feasible, or even desirable, to use them all. Thus some means must be devised for determining each feature's predictive power, also known as its gain. Once the gains are known, the features can be ranked according to their utility, and only the most gainful ones retained. This paper presents a new algorithm for computing feature gain that is fast, accurate and memory-efficient.\n",

    "Stochastic language models for speech recognition have traditionally been designed and evaluated in order to optimize word accuracy. In this work, we present a novel framework for training stochastic language models by optimizing two different criteria appropriate for speech recognition and language understanding. First, the language entropy and \"salience\" measure are used for learning the \"relevant\" spoken language features (phrases). Secondly, a novel algorithm for training stochastic finite state machines is presented which incorporates the acquired phrase structure into a single stochastic language model. Thirdly, we show the benefit of our novel framework with an end-to-end evaluation of a large vocabulary spoken language system for call routing.\n",

    "In order to improve Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) systems, it is essential to discover exactly how our current systems are underperforming. The major intellectual tool for solving this problem is error analysis: careful investigation of just which factors are contributing to errors in the recognizers. This paper presents our observations of the effects that discourse (i.e., dialog) modeling has on LVCSR system performance. As our title indicates, we emphasize the recognition error analysis methodology we developed and what it showed us as opposed to emphasizing development of the discourse model itself. In the first analysis of our output data, we focussed on errors that could be eliminated by Dialog Act discourse tagging using Dialog Act-specific language models. In a second analysis, we manipulated the parameterization of the Dialog Act-specific language models, enabling us to acquire evidence of the constraints these models introduced. The word error rate did not significantly decrease since the error rate in the largest category of Dialog Acts, namely Statements, did not significantly decrease. We did, however, observe significant error reduction in the less frequently occurring Dialog Acts and we report on the characteristic of the error corrections. We discovered that discourse models can introduce simple syntactic constraints and that they are most sensitive to parts of speech.\n",

Dividing speech repairs into three parts: erroneous part, editing term and correction, this paper provides empirical evidence which supports the notion that speech repairs are produced in a rather regular syntactic pattern. Phrases seem to play a particular role in the production of speech repairs, as phrasal boundaries frequently correspond to boundaries within or around repairs. Related acoustic-prosodic features highlighting the internal structure of repairs including F0 , duration and tonal patterns are also examined and discussed with respect to specific syntactic patterns.\n",

    "In this paper we study various decorrelation methods for the features used in speech recognition and we compare the performance of each one by running several tests with a speech database. First of all we study the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). PCA extracts the dimensions along which the data vary the most, and thus it allows us to reduce the dimension of the data points without significant loss of performance. The second transform we study is the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). As it will be shown, it is an approximation of the PCA analysis. By applying this transform to FBE parameters we obtain the MFCC coefficients. A further step is taken with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which, not only reduces the dimensionality of the problem, but also discriminates among classes to reduce the confusion error. The last method we study is Frequency Filtering (FF). This method consists of a linear filtering of the frequency sequence of the log FBE that both decorrelates and equalizes the variance of the coefficients.\n",

    "In the purpose to deal with artifact on observations measurements resulting from usual speech processing, we propose to extend the representation of the speech signal by taking a sequence of sets of observations instead of a simple sequence of observations. A set of observations is computed from temporal Multi-Resolution (MR) analysis. This method is designed to be adapted to any usual mode and technique of analysis. Its originality is to take into account two main variations in the analysis, -the center of the frame and -the duration of the frame. In speech processing, multi-resolution analysis has many applications. MR analysis is a basic representation -to locate the stationary and non-stationary parts of speech from the inertia computation, -to select the best representative observation from centroid or generalized centroid. Preliminary experiments are presented. The first one consists in the MR analysis of pieces of the French and the English-American speech databases (i.e., TIMIT, BREF80) and on the inertia as a criterion of location of stationary and non-stationary parts of the speech signal. The second one is on the computation of the phoneme prototypes of the two speech databases. At last, some perspectives are discussed.\n",

    "As part of a long term project to develop speech recognitions systems for young computer users, specifically children aged between 6 and 11 years, this paper presents a preliminary investigation into the classification of children's vowels. In earlier studies of adult speech we found that dynamic or time-varying cues were useful in classifying diphthongal vowels but provided no advantage for monophthongs if duration is included as an additional cue. In this study we investigate whether dynamic cues (modelled by Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients) are present to a greater or lesser extent in children's vowels. Our hypothesis is that some of the observed variability in children's vowels may be due to systematic time-varying features. We found that the children's monophthong data was better separated by a combination of DCT coefficients and vowel duration than by the formant data sampled at the vowel midpoint plus duration. This result contrasts with our finding on Australian adult data in which we found it was necessary to model the formant trajectory only to separate the diphthongs.\n",

    "Fixed-rate feature extraction which is used in most current speech recognizers is equivalent to sampling the feature trajectories at a uniform rate. Often this sampling rate is well below the Nyquist rate and thus leads to distortions in the sampled feature stream due to aliasing. In this paper we explore various techniques, ranging from simple cepstral and spectral smoothing to filtering and data-driven dimensionality expansion using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to counter aliasing and the variable rate nature of information in speech signals. Smoothing in the spectral domain results in a reduction in the variance of the short term spectral estimates which directly translates to reduction in the variances of the Gaussians in the acoustic models. With these techniques we obtain modest improvements, both in word error rate and robustness to noise, on large vocabulary speech recognition tasks.\n",

    "Software engineering for research and development in the area of signal processing is by no means unimportant. For speech processing, in particular, it should be a priority: given the intrinsic complexity of text-to-speech or recognition systems, there is little hope to do state-of-the-art research without solid and extensible code. This paper describes a simple and efficient methodology for the design of maximally reusable and extensible software components for speech and signal processing. The resulting programming paradigm allows software components to be advantageously combined with each other in a way that recalls the concept of hardware plug-and-play, without the need for incorporating complex schedulers to control data flows. It has been successfully used for the design of a software library for high-level speech processing systems at AT&T Labs, as well as for several other large-scale software projects.\n",

    "In speaker independent speech recognition, one problem we often face is the insufficient database for training. This problem is even more serious for children database. Besides, adult data when used as children data is affected by differences in pitch and spectral frequency stretch that affects recognition. In this paper, as an approach to solve the above problem, we applied STRAIGHT-TEMPO algorithm to morph adult data towards children data, in order to construct more robust HMM acoustic models, as well as to study the effect of a combined change in the pitch and spectral frequency stretch of the original utterances in the database. Using the morphed database, we analyzed the level of improvement that can be obtained, in terms of recognition rate, compared with non morphed data.\n",

    "This paper describes a voice conversion system based on parameter transformation. Voice conversion is a process of making one person's voice \"source\" sound like another person's voice \"target\". We will present a voice conversion scheme consisting of three stages. First an analysis is performed on the natural speech to obtain the acoustical parameters. These parameters will be voiced and unvoiced regions, the glottal source model, pitch, energy, formants and bandwidths. Once these parameters have been obtained for two different speakers they are transformed using linear functions. Finally the transformed parameters are synthesized by means of a formant synthesizer. Experiments will show that this scheme is effective in transforming the speaker individuality. It will also be shown that the transformation can not be unique from one speaker to another but it has to be divided in several functions each to transform a certain part of the speech signal. Segmentation based on spectral stability will divide the sentence into parts, for each segment a transformation function will be applied.\n",

    "Part of the problems in noise robust speech recognition can be attributed to poor acoustic modeling and use of inappropriate features. It is known that the human auditory system is superior to the best speech recognizer currently available. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new two-stream feature extractor that incorporates some of the key functions of the peripheral auditory subsystem. To enhance noise robustness, the input is divided into low-pass and high-pass channels to form so-called static and dynamic streams. These two streams are independently processed and recombined to produce a single stream, containing 13 feature vector components, with improved linguistic information. Speaker-dependent isolated-word recognition tests, using the proposed front-end, produced an average 39% and 17% error rate reductions, over all noisy environments, as compared to the standard Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) front-ends with 13 (statics only) and 26 (statics and deltas) feature vector components, respectively.\n",

First, heterogeneous acoustic measurements are chosen in order to maximize the acoustic-phonetic information extracted from the speech signal in preprocessing. Second, classifier systems are presented for successfully utilizing high-dimensional acoustic measurement spaces. The techniques used for achieving these two goals can be broadly categorized as hierarchical, committee-based, or a hybrid of these two. This paper presents committee-based and hybrid approaches. In context-independent classification and context-dependent recognition on the TIMIT core test set using 39 classes, the system achieved error rates of 18.3% and 24.4%, respectively. These error rates are the lowest we have seen reported on these tasks. In addition, experiments with a telephone-based weather information word recognition task led to word error rate reductions of 10-16%.\n",

Phonetic features are introduced which capture the transitional dynamics across a phoneme unit via a DCT transformation of a variable length segment. Alongside this, the use of a hybrid phoneme model is proposed. Classification experiments demonstrate the potential of these features and this model to match the performance of standard HMM. The extension of these features to full recognition is explored and details of a novel recognition framework presented alongside preliminary results. Lattice rescoring based on these models and features is also explored. This reduces the set of segmentations considered allowing a more detailed exploration of the nature of the model and features and the challenges in using the proposed recognition strategy.\n",

    "Both for robust fundamental frequency (F0) measurement and to provide a degree of voicing indication, a new algorithm has been developed based on multi-channel autocorrelation analysis. The speech is filtered into eight separate frequency bands, representing the lowest 500 Hz and seven overlapping band-pass channels each about 1000 Hz wide. The outputs of all the band-pass channels are full-wave rectified and band-pass filtered between 50 Hz and 500 Hz. Autocorrelation functions are calculated for the signals from all eight channels, and these functions are used both for the F0 measurement and for the voicing indication. Optional dynamic programming is provided to maximize the continuity of position of the correlation peaks selected for fundamental period measurement. The algorithm has been designed for coding onto a 16-bit integer DSP, using less than 4 MIPS processing power and 1500 words of data memory.\n",

    "The alternative approach to speech recognition proposed here is based on pseudo-articulatory representations (PARs), which can be described as approximations of distinctive features, and aims to establish a mapping between them and their acoustic specifications (in this case cepstral coefficients). This mapping which is used as the basis for recognition is first done for vowels. It is obtained using multiple regression analysis after all the vowels have been described in terms of phonetic features and an average cepstral vector has been calculated for each of them. Based on this vowel model, the PAR values are calculated for consonants. At this point recognition is performed using a brute search mechanism to derive PAR trajectories and subsequently dynamic programming to obtain a phone sequence. The results are not as good as when hidden Markov modelling is used, but very promising taking into account the early stage of the experiments and the novelty of the approach.\n",

    "We propose a new method for emphasizing the periodicity of voice wave using chaotic neurons, and propose a practical method to detect the fundamental frequency of human voice. The chaotic neuron is a kind of nonlinear recursive mapping proposed in the field of nonlinear theory and is usually used to generate the chaotic signal. Besides, when the chaotic neuron is considered in the theory of linear signal processing, we can interpret that the chaotic neuron is a positive feedback IIR digital filter of first order, therefore, it gives a spectrum slope to the target spectrum of input speech signal. In this study, we try to tune up the chaotic neuron to amplify the low frequency components to emphasize the component of fundamental frequency. As the result, spectrum peaks based on the formants are canceled, the spectrum peak corresponded to the fundamental frequency of voiced speech can be detected easily. In addition, a nonlinear function that has a dead band is included in the feedback loop of the chaotic neuron. As its effect, noise components of unvoiced speech are not amplified.\n",

The ultimate goal of this work is to generate syllable models whose parameters explicitly describe the trajectories of the phonetic features of the syllable. We hope to move away from Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of context-dependent phone units.

    "The hidden Markov modelling experiments presented in this paper show that consonant identification results can be improved substantially if a neural network is used to extract linguistically relevant information from the acoustic signal before applying hidden Markov modelling. The neural network - or in this case a combination of two Kohonen networks - takes 12 mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, overall energy and the corresponding delta parameters as input and outputs distinctive phonetic features, like [(plus-minus)uvular] and [(plus-minus)plosive]. Not only does this preprocessing of the data lead to better consonant identification rates, the confusions that occur between the consonants are less severe from a phonetic viewpoint, as is demonstrated. One reason for the improved consonant identification is that the acoustically variable consonant realisations can be mapped onto identical phonetic features by the neural network. This makes the input to hidden Markov modelling more homogenous and improves consonant identification. Furthermore, by using phonetic features the neural network helps the system to focus on linguistically relevant information in the acoustic signal.\n",

Autocorrelation coefficients on the mel-frequency axis are exactly derived by computing cross-correlation coefficients between speech signal and all-pass filtered one without any approximation. This method requires only two-fold computational cost as compared to conventional linear prediction analysis. The recognition performance of mel-cepstral parameters obtained by the Mel LPC analysis is compared with those of conventional LP mel-cepstra and the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) through gender-dependent phoneme and word recognition tests. The results show that the Mel-LPC cepstrum attains a significant improvement in recognition accuracy over conventional LP mel-cepstrum, and gives slightly higher accuracy for male speakers and slightly lower accuracy for female speakers than MFCC.\n",

The multi-resolution approach is based on the premise that additional cues for phonetic discrimination may exist in the spectral correlates of a particular sub-band, but not in another. Weights are derived via discriminative training using the 'Minimum Classification Error' (MCE) criterion on log-likelihood scores. Using this criterion the weights for correct and competing classes are adjusted in opposite directions, thus conveying the sense of enforcing separation of confusable classes. Discriminative re-combination is shown to provide significant increases for both phone classification and continuous recognition tasks on the TIMIT database. Weighted recombination of independent multi-resolution sub-band models is also shown to provide robustness improvements in broadband noise.\n",

    "Our goal is to develop a singing synthesis system, in which \"singing units\" are automatically extracted from existing musical recordings of a singer accompanied by a musical instrument (piano). This paper concentrates on the problem of separating singer from accompaniment. Existing separation methods require the knowledge of the exact frequencies of the signals to be separated, and are prone to degrading the quality of the separated signals. In this paper, we use the framework of the sinusoidal modeling approach. We suggest the use of further sources of information, available to the specific task: advance knowledge of the music score, knowledge about the piano sound, and a relatively large database of the piano and singer signals, which is used to build a model of the piano sound. Results show that using musical score information and piano note modeling can improve separation quality.\n",

    "Correlation of spectral variations and F0 changes in a vowel is firstly analyzed, where the variations are also compared to VQ distortions calculated in a five-vowel space. It is shown that the F0 change approximately by a half octave produces the spectral variation comparable to the VQ distortion when the codebook size is the number of the vowels. Next, a model to predict the cepstral coefficients' variations caused by the F0 changes is built using the multivariate regression analysis. Experiments show that the generated frame by the model has a remarkably small distance to the target frame. Furthermore, the model is evaluated separately in terms of a spectral envelope predictor with a given F0 and a mapping function of feature sub-spaces. While the models should be built dependently on phonemes and speakers as the former, adequate selection of parameters can enable the speaker/phoneme-independent models to work effectively as the latter.\n",

    "Many speech recognition systems use logarithmic filter-bank energies or a linear transformation of them to represent the speech signal. Usually, each of those energies is routinely computed as a weighted average of the periodogram samples that lie in the corresponding frequency band. In this work, we attempt to gain an insight into the statistical properties of the frequency-averaged periodogram (FAP) from which those energies are samples. Thus, we have shown that the FAP is statistically and asymptotically equivalent to a multiwindow estimator that arises from the Thomson[HEX 146]s optimization approach and uses orthogonal sinusoids as windows. The FAP and other multiwindow estimators are tested in a speech recognition application, observing the influence of several design factors. Particularly, a technique that is computationally simple like the FAP[HEX 146]s one, and which is equivalent to use multiple cosine windows, appears as an alternative to be taken into consideration.\n",

The computational complexity will be a problem, but the proposed implementation in a wavelet transform domain promotes the faster convergence in the analysis of speech signal.\n",

    "This paper presents a class of methods for automatically extracting formant parameters from speech. The methods rely on an iterative optimization algorithm. It was found that formant parameter data derived with these methods was less prone to discontinuity errors than conventional methods. Also, experiments were conducted that demonstrated that these methods are capable of better accuracy in formant estimation than LPC, especially for the first formant. In some cases, the analytic (non-iterative) solution has been derived, making real time applications feasible. The main target that we have been pursuing is text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. These methods are being used to automatically analyze a concatenation database, without the need for a tuning phase to fix errors. In addition, they are instrumental in realizing high quality pitch tracking, and pitch epoch marking.\n",

    "This investigation focuses on deriving local speech rate directly out of the speech signal, which differs from syllable rate and from phone rate. Since local speech rate modifies acoustic cues (e.g. transitions), phones, and even words, it is one of the most important prosodic cues. Our local speech rate estimation method is based on a linear combination of the syllable rate and of the phone rate, since this investigation strongly suggests that neither the syllable rate nor the phone rate on its own represent the speech rate sufficiently. Our results show (a) that perceptual local speech rate correlates better with local syllable rate than with local phone rate (r=0.81>r=0.73), (b) that the linear combination of both is well-correlated with perceptual local speech rate (r=0.88), and (c) that it is now possible to calculate the perceptual local speech rate with the aid of automatic phone boundary detectors and syllable nuclei detectors directly from the speech signal.\n",

    "For nasal vowels, a gesture as simple as the lowering of the velum produces complex acoustic spectra. However, we still find a relative simplicity in the perceptual space; nasality is perceived easily. In this preliminary study, we use statistic method to recover the gesture of the velum. In order to reduce the extreme variability of nasal vowels, we introduced a simulation based on Maeda's model instead of using a natural speech signal. In previous studies, nasality is supposed to increase either with size of the nasal area or with the area ratio between nasal and oral tracts at the extremity of the velum. In this work, both types of data are considered and analyzed with linear and non-linear tools. Finally, statistic inference is described and results are given for various areas of the nasal tract entrance and for various area ratios. The results show that velar port area is correctly estimated for small values while area ratio is a better parameter when velar port area increases.\n",

    "Speech recognition systems based on hidden Markov models (HMM) favourably apply a linear discriminant analysis transform (LDA) which yields low-dimensional and uncorrelated feature components. However, since the distributions in the HMM states usually are modeled by mixture gaussian densities, the description by second-order moments no longer is correct. For this purpose we introduced a new \"extended linear discriminant analysis\" transform (ELDA) which starts from conventional LDA. The ELDA transform is derived by use of a gradient descent optimization procedure based on a \"minimum classification error\" (MCE) principle, which is applied to the original high-dimensional pattern space. The transform matrix, the best fitting prototype of the correct class (i.e. HMM state) and the nearest rival are adapted. We developed a method which additionally updates all prototypes by a separate maximum likelihood (ML) estimation step. This avoids that such means and covariances, which mostly remain unaffected by the MCE procedure, may diverge step by step.\n",

A Rosenberg-Klatt model is used to approximate a voicing source waveform for voiced speech, whereas a white noise is assumed for unvoiced. The vocal tract transfer function is represented by a pole-zero filter. For voiced speech, parameters of the source model are jointly estimated with those of the vocal tract filter. A combined algorithm is developed to estimate the vocal tract parameters, i.e., formants and anti-formants which are calculated from the poles and zeros of the filter. By the algorithm, poles are estimated based on a subspace algorithm, while zeros are estimated from the amplitude spectrum. For unvoiced speech, an AR model is assumed, which can be solved by LPC analysis. An experiment using synthesized nasal sounds shows that the poles and zeros are estimated quite accurately.\n",

Unfortunately till now there is not a satisfying kind of distance measure available for LSP so that this kind of features can be used for speech recognition applications. In this paper, the principle of LSP analysis is studied at first, and then several distance measures for LSP are proposed which can describe very well the difference between two groups of different LSP parameters.

Effective determination of the pitch in a passage of speech is believed to be fundamental for higher level speech processing applications such as speech or speaker recognition. Of particular interest is the need to extract pitch from speech in less than ideal conditions eg. in the presence of noise or using very short analysis windows. In an attempt to deliver accurate pitch estimates from relatively short analysis windows this paper describes an evaluation of two forms of the SHS procedure: in one case, FFT-SHS, the procedure uses the conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in its spectral analysis step; in the second case, RAFT-SHS, the ReAssigned Fourier Transform (RAFT) technique is used instead of the FFT.\n",

    "This paper proposes a new spectral estimation method for automatic speech recognition. The spectrum estimated with the conventional data window of around 30 ms shows harmonic structure in the voiced portions of speech data. The harmonic frequency interval is often comparable to the formant frequency interval for female voices with high F0, which results in spectral estimation error. The new idea is to estimate spectrum by taking the Lp norm of the time series of the spectrum obtained from a very short speech segment. The new method, called the micro-segment spectrum integration, provides (1) precise spectral estimation not affected by harmonic structure, and (2) noise-robustness by suppressing noisy speech segments. Phoneme recognition experiments demonstrate that the micro-segment spectrum integration method outperforms conventional spectral estimation methods.\n",

    "We have already developed time-varying complex AR (TV-CAR) parameter estimation based on minimizing mean square error (MMSE) for analytic speech signal. Although the MMSE approach is commonly and successfully applied in various parameter estimation such as conventional LPC, it is well-known that an MMSE method easily suffers from biased and inaccurate spectrum estimation due to non-Gaussian nature of glottal excitation for voiced speech in the context of speech analysis. This paper offers robust parameter estimation algorithm for the TV-CAR model by applying Huber's robust M-estimation approach and two kinds of robust algorithms are derived: Newton-type algorithm and weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm. The preliminary experiments with synthetic signal generated by glottal source model excitation and natural speech uttered by female speaker demonstrate that the time-varying complex AR method is sufficiently robust against non-Gaussian nature of glottal source excitation owing to the improved resolution in the frequency domain.\n",

    "A method for determining articulatory parameters from speech acoustics is presented. The method is based on a search of an articulatory-acoustic codebook which is designed from simultaneous observation data of articulatory motions and speech acoustics. The codebook search employs dynamic constraints on acoustic behavior as well as articulatory behavior. There are two constrains. One of the constraints is use of spectral segments in the codebook search and the other is use of the smoothness of articulatory trajectories in the articulatory parameter path search. The articulatory parameters are determined by selecting the articulatory code vector in the codebook which minimizes the weighted distance measure of segmental spectral distance and squared distance between succeeding articulatory parameters. The results of an experiment show that an rms error between the estimated and observed articulatory parameter was about 2.0 mm on average, and the articulatory features for vowels and consonants are recovered well.\n",

Principal component analysis was used to analyze the importance of individual features in representing emotional categories. Three classification methods including vector quantization, artificial neural networks and Gaussian mixture density model were used. Classifications using short-term features only, long-term features only and both short-term and long-term features were conducted. The best recognition performance of 62% accuracy was achieved by using the Gaussian mixture density method with both short-term and long-term features.\n",

    "This paper describes a phenomenological model of the auditory periphery which consists of a bank of nonlinear time-varying parallel filters. Realistic filter shapes are obtained with the all-pole gammatone filter (APGF) which provides both a good approximation of the far more complex wave-propagation or cochlear mechanics models and a very simple implementation. The model also includes an active, distributed feedback that controls the damping parameter of the APGF. As a result, the model reproduces several observed phenomena including compression and two-tone suppression. It is now used to study responses to complex stimuli in models of the auditory nerve and cochlear nucleus neurons and to provide physiologically plausible front-end for speech analysis.\n",

    "Speech production models, coding methods as well as text to speech technology often lead to the introduction of modulation models to represent speech signals with primary components which are amplitude-and-phase-modulated sine functions. Parallelisms between properties of the wavelet transform of primary components and algorithmic representations of speech signals derived from auditory nerve models like the EIH lead to the introduction of synchrosqueezing measures. On the other hand, in automatic speech (and speaker) recognition, cepstral feature have imposed themselves quasi-universally as acoustic characteristic of speech utterances. This paper analyses cepstral representation in the context of the synchrosqueezed representation - wastrum. It discusses energy accumulation derived wastra as opposed to classical MEL and LPC derived cepstra. In the former method the primary components and formants play a primary role. Recognition results are presented on the Wall Street Journal database using IBM continuous decoder.\n",

    "The paper gives an overall discussion on problems in Chinese natural speech generation. A Chinese Bi-directional Grammar is developed to suit for Chinese Language understanding and generation. A comprehensive discription about the structure of characteristic network of all ranks in language have been built up. In Natural language generation, text planning is proceeded at first to extract concrete content related to the semantic. Through text organization the internal generation structure is formed. Grammar realization transforms internal structure to natural language. After the text of natural language generated, the next step is to convert the text into speech. We build up a speech characteristic database with speech of 50 thousand phrases and hundreds of pronunciation rules. After recognizing the structure of the input text and abstracting the rhythm characteristics in text, the database gives completely a description from Chinese characters to speech. The whole Chinese character in GB2312-80 can be described to speech. Based on the research all above, a natural speech generation system is established. It can automatically plan and organize the output sentences in natural speech. The synthetic speech has good quality in naturalness and intelligibility.\n",

    "The increasing interest in the statistical approach to Machine Translation is due to the development of effective algorithms for training the probabilistic models proposed so far. However, one of the problems with Statistical Machine Translation is the design of efficient algorithms for translating a given input string. For some interesting models, only (good) approximate solutions can be found. Recently a Dynamic- Programming-like algorithm has been introduced which computes approximate solutions for some models. These solutions can be improved by using an iterative algorithm that refines the successive solutions and uses a smoothing technique for some probabilistic distribution of the models based on an interpolation of different distributions. The technique resulting from this combination has been tested on the \"Tourist Task\" corpus, which was generated in a semi-automated way. The best results achieved were a translation word-error rate of 9.3% and a sentence-error rate of 44.4%.\n",

Bilingual text generation is accomplished by filling the templates after which grammar components generate the final text. The interfaces between the templates and the language-specific text generators are marked for prosodic information resulting in a text output where deaccentuation, accentuation, levels of focal accentuation, and phrasing are specified. These prosodic markers, which are primarily dependent on the giveness/newness structure of the text, modify the default prosody rules of the text-to-speech system which then reads the text with subsequent improvement in intonation.\n",

    "In speech translation, recognition errors produced by the speech recognition process can cause parsing and translation errors. Because of this, the development of a robust error handling framework is quite essential to improve the performance of the speech translation system. Previously, a robust translation method was proposed by Wakita, which translates only reliable parts in utterances. In this method, however, the recall of translated parts for a whole utterance is low, and sometimes no translation is output. In this paper, we propose an example-based error recovery method to solve the low recall problem of Wakita's method. The proposed method recovers an unreliable utterance, by repairing the parse-tree of the utterance based on similar example parse-trees in the tree- bank. A recovered translation is generated from the recovered tree.\n",

    "Probably the best current algorithm for generating definite descriptions is the Incremental Algorithm due to Dale and Reiter. If we want to use this algorithm in a Concept-to-Speech system, however, we encounter two limitations: (1) the algorithm is insensitive to the linguistic context and thus always produces the same description for an object, (2) the output is a list of properties which uniquely determine one object from a set of objects: how this list is to be expressed in spoken natural language is not addressed. We propose a modification of the Incremental Algorithm based on the idea that a definite description refers to the most salient element in the current context satisfying the descriptive content. We show that the modified algorithm allows for the context-sensitive generation of both distinguishing and anaphoric descriptions, while retaining the attractive properties of Dale and Reiter's original algorithm.\n",

The discourse structure of the route description is related closely to the knowledge representation of the route. The NLG component includes a pitch accenting algorithm which places appropriate pitch accents on elements of the utterance requiring particular emphasis or stress. Our pitch accenting algorithm uses a domain knowledge base and a discourse history. From these it determines whether information selected to form the content of the utterance is shared mutual domain knowledge, given information, or new information. It can then assign an appropriate pitch accent to one word in each prosodic phrase. The text-to-speech component then determines the appropriate syllable to be accented in the word.\n",

    "The goal of this work was to develop a speech synthesis system which concatenates variable-length units to create natural-sounding speech. Our initial work showed that by careful design of system responses to ensure consistent intonation contours, natural-sounding speech synthesis was achievable with word- and phrase-level concatenation. In order to extend the flexibility of this framework, we focused on generating novel words from a corpus of sub-word units. The design of the corpus was motivated by perceptual experiments that investigated where speech could be spliced with minimal audible distortion and what contextual constraints were necessary to maintain in order to produce natural-sounding speech. From this sub-word corpus, a Viterbi search selects a sequence of units based on how well they match the input specification and concatenation constraints. This concatenative speech synthesis system, ENVOICE, has been used in a conversational system in two application domains to convert meaning representations into speech waveforms.\n",

    "The defining property of a Concept-to-Speech system is that it combines language and speech generation. Language generation converts the input-concepts into natural language, which speech generation subsequently transforms into speech. Potentially, this leads to a more `natural sounding' output than can be achieved in a plain Text-to-Speech system, since the correct placement of pitch accents and intonational boundaries ---an important factor contributing to the `naturalness' of the generated speech--- is co-determined by syntactic and discourse information, which is typically available in the language generation module. In this paper, a generic algorithm for the generation of coherent spoken monologues is discussed, called D2S. Language generation is done by a module called LGM which is based on TAG-like syntactic structures with open slots, combined with conditions which determine when the syntactic structure can be used properly. A speech generation module converts the output of the LGM into speech using either phrase-concatenation or diphone-synthesis.\n",

    "We describe a method for learning head-transducer models of translation automatically from examples consisting of transcribed spoken utterances and reference translations of the utterances. The method proceeds by first searching for a hierarchical alignment (specifically a synchronized dependency tree) of each training example. The alignments produced are optimal with respect to a cost function that takes into account co-occurrence statistics and the recursive decomposition of the example into aligned substrings. A probabilistic head-transducer model is then constructed from the alignments. We report results of applying the method to English-to-Spanish translation in the domain of air travel information and English-to-Japanese translation in the domain of telephone operator assistance. We also report on a variation on this model-construction method in which multi-word pairings are used in the computation of the hierarchical alignments and head transducer models.\n",

    "In this paper, we offer an alternative to ToBI, the current de facto standard for machine-readable labelling of English prosody. We have three reasons for arguing that an alternative is needed. Firstly, the ToBI tone inventory is not maximally constrained; it appears to be difficult for transcribers to reach high inter-transcriber agreement scores for tone labels. Secondly, the growing demand for prosodically labelled data from non-standard varieties of English suggests a need for a transparent comparative transcription system. ToBI was not designed for this purpose. Thirdly, the low inter-transcriber agreement scores for ToBI suggest that the system is not as easy to apply as it may at first appear. In the present paper, we describe an alternative: the IViE system (Intonational Variation in English). We describe the structure of IViE and discuss its application with examples.\n",

Secondly, many acoustic prosodic features are derived and the break indices are labeled with these features by decision trees.

    "An automated speech signal labeling tool, developed for the QuickSig speech database environment, is described. It is based primarily on the use of neural networks as diphone event detectors. For robustness, only coarse categories of diphones, such as stop-vowel and vowel-nasal, are used. 64 such detectors are implemented to cover all of the Finnish diphones. The preprocessing of speech signals is carried out using warped linear prediction and the diphone events from neural network outputs are matched to the given text transcription using a simple rule-based parser. In the case of isolated word labeling of single speaker signals a well trained system makes about 1-2 % of coarse labeling errors and the deviation of boundary positions, compared to careful manual labeling, is on average about 10 ms. Generalization ability to label other speakers shows promising.\n",

It is imperative to improve the quality of segmentations and transcriptions of the training data to achieve better acoustic modeling. By adapting existing acoustic models to only a small subset of such improved transcriptions, we have achieved a 2% absolute improvement in performance.\n",

    "In spoken dialogue systems, the minimal unit of analysis does not necessarily correspond to a full sentence. A possible approach for language processing is that of splitting the sentence in a sequence of units that can be successively processed by linguistic modules. The goal of the Semantic Boundary (SB) detector is to locate boundaries inside a sentence in order to obtain such minimal units. Useful information for SB detection can be extracted both from the acoustic signal of the utterance and from its corresponding word sequence. In the paper techniques for semantic boundary prediction, based on both acoustic and lexical knowledge, will be presented. Furthermore, a method for combining the two knowledge sources will be proposed. Finally, performance obtained on a corpus of hundreds of person-to-person dialogues will be provided. Best result gives 62.8% recall and 71.8% precision.\n",

Our method is based on a very fast presegmentation algorithm which uses a new statistical modeling of speech and searching in a multilevel structure, called Dendrogram, for decreasing insertion rate. Performance of algorithms have been tested over a large set of TIMIT sentences. According to these tests, our final segmentation algorithm is capable of detecting nearly 97% of segments with an average boundary position error of less than 7 msec and average insertion rate of less than 12.7%. In addition to acceptable precision, our overall segmentation scheme has very low computation cost and it can be implemented in real time on an average Pentium PC. The major advantage of presented algorithms is that no training or threshold estimation is needed in realizing them. Details of proposed algorithms and their performance results are included in the paper.\n",

At the first step, PBI was predicted with the information of syllable and pause duration through the linear discriminant analysis(LDA) method. At the second step, syllable tone information was used to estimate PBI. In this step we used vector quantization(VQ) for coding the syllable tones and PBI is estimated by tri-tone model. In the last step, two PBI predictors were integrated by a weight factor. The LDA-VQ method was tested on 200 literal style spoken sentences. The experimental results showed 72% accuracy.\n",

    "With the advent of spoken language computer interface systems, the storage and management of speech corpora is becoming more of an issue in the development of such systems. Until recently, even large corpora were stored as individual text and speech files, or as a single, monolithic file. The issues involved in management and retrieval of the data have been, to a large extent, overlooked. Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are proposed as an ideal tool for the management of speech corpora. Relationships between words and phonemes, and the realisations of these, can be stored and retrieved efficiently. RDBMS may be constructed with various levels, to store speaker, language, label transcription, and phonetic information, plus speech as isolated words, and derived segmented units. An implementation of such a system is presented to manage the Otago Speech Corpus, currently called Management Of Otago Speech Environment (MOOSE). The ability of the MOOSE to be applied to other corpora is currently under investigation.\n",

Both systems have been evaluated on French read utterances from a speaker never seen in the training stage of the HMM/ANN system and manually segmented. This study outlines the advantages and drawbacks of both methods. The high quality speech synthetic system has the great advantage that no training stage is needed, while the classical HMM/ANN system easily allows multiple phonetic transcriptions. We deduce a method for the automatic constitution of phonetically labeled speech databases based on using the synthetic speech segmentation tool to bootstrap the training process of our hybrid HMM/ANN system. The importance of such segmentation tools will be a key point for the development of improved speech synthesis and recognition systems.\n",

    "This paper describes a world-wide web based system which allows a speech data corpus developer to interact with a system for the comprehensive description of a spoken language data corpus. The interface at the browser allows the user to define the speaking environment that is to be described and then progressively to describe it and all the data files arising from it in a modular fashion. The quality of the description can be tested incrementally and the feedback generated used to further update the description. The user is effectively guided through the necessary modules in a way that reminds but does not demand adherence to a strict pattern. The complete data description can be displayed on screen and also downloaded in a simple text form to the user. Users may register as clients of the system in which case they can store descriptions on the system and upgrade these descriptions at any time.\n",

In order to improve this script warping, a new algorithm has been developed to split audio data into silence, noise, music and speech segments without training step. This segments splitting uses multiple techniques such as voiced/unvoiced segmentation, pitch detection, pitch tracking, speaker and speech recognition techniques. The 102.47 minutes of the film movie \"Contes de Printemps\" produced by E. Rohmer have been indexed with these techniques with an average shifting lower than one second between the time-code script and audio data.\n",

    "We present methods for finding same or almost same news stories in the hourly radio news broadcasts spoken by the same or different announcers. They allow to establish a large database of repeated and professionally read speech at low costs that is especially interesting for prosody research, but also, e.g., for concept-to-speech and socio-linguistic studies. An automatically recorded complete radio news broadcast is first segmented into individual news stories using HMM recognition. Then, the word sequence estimates of the stories are either compared directly (naive method) or realigned with the signal of other stories (realignment method) to find out which stories were read before and which not. Both methods can be further improved by computing ``meta distances'' that also take into account distances to other stories. We find that the realignment method combined with meta distances is the most reliable of the methods on real life data.\n",

Typical algorithms for this task use only phoneme-to-frame similarity measures which are somehow maximised or minimised. In addition to such similarity measures, we use phoneme duration hypotheses generated by the speech synthesis system HADIFIX. For algorithms based on dynamic programming, it is difficult to use these duration hypotheses, so we create a cost-function consisting of phoneme-to-frame and segment-to-duration hypotheses similarity measures and minimise this cost-function by a Genetic Algorithm. The results show that the accuracy of automatically determined phoneme boundaries increases. This accounts especially for speakers not used in the training phase.\n",

    "In this paper we address the problem of aligning very long (often more than one hour) audio files to their corresponding textual transcripts in an effective manner. We present an efficient recursive technique to solve this problem that works well even on noisy speech signals. The key idea of this algorithm is to turn the forced alignment problem into a recursive speech recognition problem with a gradually restricting dictionary and language model. The algorithm is tolerant to acoustic noise and errors or gaps in the text transcript or audio tracks. We report experimental results on a 3 hour audio file containing TV and radio broadcasts. We will show accurate alignments on speech under a variety of real acoustic conditions such as speech over music and speech over telephone lines. We also report results when the same audio stream has been corrupted with white additive noise or compressed using a popular web encoding format such as RealAudio. This algorithm has been used in our internal multimedia indexing project. It has processed more than 200 hours of audio from varied sources, such as WGBH NOVA documentaries and NPR web audio files. The system aligns speech media content in about one to five times realtime, depending on the acoustic conditions of the audio signal.\n",

A symbolic coding of the 50000 pitch movements of the corpus is also provided, along with the time-alignment of orthographic transcription to signal at word-level.

    "This paper presents a formalism that models speech from different databases generically. For each utterance in a speech database a communication framework is first constructed which is composed of a set of communication planes, such as acoustic, orthographic, linguistic, and phonetic. Each plane in turn is made up of a set of levels to represent the plane's structural hierarchy, e.g., for the linguistic plane, levels such as sentence, word, syllable, and phoneme may exist. Information from speech databases is parsed and compiled into such objects and exhibit both individual and class inherited behaviour. Once placed into the framework these objects can have their relationships to other objects explicitly defined by links on the same level, across different levels, and across different planes. Speech from databases covering different languages and annotation styles can therefore be modelled generically allowing for uniform database access. Searches can be performed on the framework and the results used for further analyses.\n",

This paper describes a connectionist-HMM system for broadcast news transcription, and the modifications to this system necessary for real-time operation. We show that real-time operation is possible with a relative increase in word error rate of about 12%.\n",

    "This paper describes preliminary results of automatic recognition of Korean broadcast-news speech. We have been working on flexible vocabulary isolated-word speech recognition, and the same HMM models are used for broadcast-news continuous speech recognition. The recognizer is trained by using phonetically balanced isolated words speech, rather than the broadcast news speech itself. In this research, we use several different lexica to investigate the recognition performance according to the length of the words. We also propose a long-distance bigram language model, which can be used at the first stage of the search, so that it can reduce the recognition errors caused by earlier pruning of correct hypothesis.\n",

    "Radio and television broadcasts consist of a continuous stream of data comprised of segments of different linguistic and acoustic natures, which poses challenges for transcription. In this paper we report on our recent work in transcribing broadcast news data, including the problem of partitioning the data into homogeneous segments prior to word recognition. Gaussian mixture models are used to identify speech and non-speech segments. A maximum-likelihood segmentation/clustering process is then applied to the speech segments using GMMs and an agglomerative clustering algorithm. The clustered segments are then labeled according to bandwidth and gender. The recognizer is a continuous mixture density, tied-state cross-word context-dependent HMM system with a 65k trigram language model. Decoding is carried out in three passes, with a final pass incorporating cluster-based test-set MLLR adaptation. The overall word transcription error on the Nov'97 unpartitioned evaluation test data was 18.5%.\n",

    "It is well known that good language models improve performance of speech recognition. One requirement for the estimation of language models is a sufficient amount of texts of the application domain. If not all words of the domain occur in the training texts for language models, a way must be found to model these words adequately. In this paper we report on a new approach of building word classes for language modeling in the bilingual (German, Italian) SpeeData project. The main idea is to classify words according to their morphological properties. Therefore we decompose words into their morphological units and put the words with the same prefix or suffix into the same class. Since morphological decomposition is error prone for unknown word stems, we also decomposed words by counting beginnings and endings of different length and used these subunits like prefixes and suffixes. The advantage of this approach is that it can be carried out automatically. We achieved a reduction in error rate from 9.83 % to 5.77 % for morphological decomposition and 5.99 % for automatical decomposition which can be performed without any morphological knowledge.\n",

    "Combining different language models is an important task. Linear interpolation is the established method to do this. We will present a new method called log-linear interpolation (LLI) which combines the simplicity of linear interpolation with essential parts from maximum-entropy models by linearly interpolating the scores of different models. The first series of experiments focuses on adaptation. Unigram, bigram and trigram models trained on NAB are combined with unigram and bigram models trained on a small domain specific corpus. LLI compares favorably with linear interpolation. The second series combines bigram and distance-bigram models. Here, relative improvements are larger (~20% in perplexity). This task seems to be the ideal application of LLI. To further scrutinize the method, first frequent pairs of words are joined to phrases and next, bigram and distance-bigram are combined by LLI. This experiment yields perplexities just 2.5% above the original trigram perplexity.\n",

    "In January 1993, BBN demonstrated for the first time a real-time, 20K-word, speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition system, implemented in software on an off-the-shelf workstation. The key to the real-time system was a novel, proprietary fast-match algorithm which had two important properties: high-accuracy recognition and run-time proportional to only the cube root of the vocabulary size. This paper describes that fast-match algorithm in detail. While a number of fast-match algorithms have been published, the BBN algorithm continues to have novel features that have not appeared in the literature. In this fast-match, the vocabulary is organized as a phonetic tree. The last phonemes of the words always locate at the leaves. Each node of the phonetic tree is assigned a set id representing a group of words which share this node. The acoustic models associated with the nodes are the composite triphones where there could be more than one right context. The language models used in this fast-match are the Pr(set_of_words|some_word) which are evaluated at every node of the words during the search. The search itself is similar to the usual beam search with one addition: To activate a node, we temporarily use some set bigrams; to leave that node, we take out that temporary bigram.\n",

    "We propose an efficient two-pass search algorithm for LVCSR. Instead of conventional word graph, the first preliminary pass generates \"word trellis index\", keeping track of all survived word hypotheses within the beam every time-frame. As it represents all found word boundaries non-deterministically, we can (1) obtain accurate sentence-dependent hypotheses on the second search, and (2) avoid expensive word-pair approximation on the first pass. The second pass performs an efficient stack decoding search, where the index is referred to as predicted word list and heuristics. Experimental results on 5,000-word Japanese dictation task show that, compared with the word-graph method, this trellis-based method runs with less than 1/10 memory cost while keeping high accuracy. Finally, by handling inter-word context dependency, we achieved the word error rate of 5.6%.\n",

In this paper we address the problem of unlimited vocabulary. We show, that this problem is more serious for German than it is for English. Using a speech recognition system with a large vocabulary, we dynamically adapt the active vocabulary to the topic of the current news segment. This is done by using information retrieval (IR) techniques on a large collection of texts automatically gathered from the internet. The same technique is also used to adapt the language model of the recognition system. The process of vocabulary adaptation and language model retraining is completely unsupervised.

    "We present a study of data simulated using acoustic models trained on Switchboard data, and then recognized using various Switchboard-trained models. Simple development models give a word error rate (WER) of about 47%, when recognizing real Switchboard conversations. If we simulate speech from word transcriptions, obtaining the word pronunciations from our recognition dictionary, the WER drops by a factor of five to ten. If we use more realistic hand-labeled phonetic transcripts to fabricate data, we obtain WERs in the low 40's, close to those found in actual speech data. These and other experiments we describe in the paper suggest that there is a substantial mismatch between real speech and the combination of our acoustic models and the pronunciations in our recognition dictionary. The use of simulation in speech recognition research appears to be a promising tool in our efforts to understand and reduce the size of this mismatch.\n",

    "In this paper, an m-level optimal subtree based phonetic decision tree clustering algorithm is described. Unlike prior approaches, the m-level optimal subtree in the proposed approach is to generate log likelihood estimates using multiple mixture Gaussians for phonetic decision tree based state tying. It provides a more accurate model of the log likelihood variations in node splitting and it is consistent with the acoustic space partition introduced by the set of phonetic questions applied during the decision tree state tying process. In order to reduce the algorithmic complexity, a caching scheme based on previous search results is also described. It leads to a significant speed up of the m-level optimal subtree construction without degradation of the recognition performance, making the proposed approach suitable for large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. Experimental results on a standard (Wall Street Journal) speech recognition task indicate that the proposed m-level optimal subtree approach outperforms the conventional approach of using single mixture Gaussians in phonetic decision tree based state tying.\n",

    "Current speech recognition systems require large amounts of expensive transcribed data for parameter estimation. In this work we describe our experiments which are aimed at training a speech recognizer without transcriptions. The experiments were carried out with untranscribed TV newscast recordings. The newscasts were automatically segmented into segments of similar acoustic background condition. We develop a training scheme, where a recognizer is bootstrapped using very little transcribed data and is improved using new, untranscribed speech. We show that it is necessary to use a confidence measure to judge the initial transcriptions of the recognizer before using them. Higher improvements can be achieved if the number of parameters in the system is increased when more data becomes available. We show, that the beneficial effect of unsupervised training is not compensated by MLLR adaptation on the hypothesis. Using the described methods, we found that the untranscribed data gives roughly one third of the improvement of the transcribed material.\n",

By using the look-phone-context property, the number of acoustic matches can be substantially reduced in the course of scoring all possible phonetic transcriptions of recognition hypotheses. Experiments on the speaker-independent Wall Street Journal task show that a fast-response system can be reached without compromising the accuracy.\n",

    "In an HMM based large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system, the evaluation of - context dependent - acoustic models is very time consuming. In Semi-Continuous HMMs, a state is modelled as a mixture of elementary - generally gaussian - probability density functions. Observation probability calculations of these states can be made faster by reducing the size of the mixture of gaussians used to model them. In this paper, we propose different criteria to decide which gaussians should remain in the mixture for a state, and which ones can be removed. The performance of the criteria is compared on context dependent tied state models using the WSJ recognition task. Our novel criterion, which decides to remove a gaussian in a state if it is based on too few acoustic data, outperforms the other described criteria.\n",

    "Most current state-of-the-art large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems are based on state-clustered hidden Markov models (HMMs). Typical systems use thousands of state clusters, each represented by a Gaussian mixture model with a few tens of Gaussians. In this paper, we show that models with far more parameter tying, like phonetically tied mixture (PTM) models, give better performance in terms of both recognition accuracy and speed. In particular, we achieved between a 5 and 10% improvement in word error rate, while cutting the number of Gaussian distance computations in half, for three different Wall Street Journal (WSJ) test sets, by using a PTM system with 38 phone-class state clusters, as compared to a state-clustered system with 937 state clusters. For both systems, the total number of Gaussians was fixed at about 30,000. This result is of real practical significance as we show that a conceptually simpler PTM system can achieve faster and more accurate performance than current state-of-the-art state-clustered HMM systems.\n",

    "As speech recognition systems are increasingly applied to real world problems, it is often desirable to use the same recognition engine for a variety of tasks of differing complexity. This paper explores the relationship between the complexity of the recognition task and the best strategies for pruning the recognition search space. We examine two types of task: 20000 word WSJ dictation, and phone book access using a 60 word grammar. For both tasks we compare two strategies for pruning the search space: absolute pruning, where the number of hypotheses is controlled by eliminating ones that have a score less than a fixed beamwidth below the best scoring hypothesis, and rank based pruning, where hypotheses are ranked by score and all hypotheses beneath a certain rank are eliminated. We present statistics characterizing the behaviour of the recognizer under different pruning strategies and show how the strategies affect error-rates.\n",

Each word in the speech-to-text output for a given utterance is annotated with these two measures. Likelihood dependence for a given word occurrence indicates how critical that word is to the overall utterance likelihood; i.e., how much worse is the likelihood of the next best utterance if that word is eliminated from the recognition. Neighborhood dependence measures how stable a given word is when neighboring words are changed in the recognition. We show that correct and incorrect words in the recognition behave significantly differently with respect to these measures. We also show that on the broadcast news task they perform better than some of the existing, commonly used measures.\n",

    "The goal of multi-span language modeling is to integrate the various constraints, both local and global, that are present in the language. In this paper, local constraints are captured via the usual n-gram approach, while global constraints are taken into account through the use of latent semantic analysis. An integrative formulation is derived for the combination of these two paradigms, resulting in an entirely data-driven, multi-span framework for large vocabulary speech recognition. Because of the inherent complementarity in the two types of constraints, the performance of the integrated language model compares favorably with the corresponding n-gram performance. On a subset of the Wall Street Journal speaker-independent, 20,000-word vocabulary, continuous speech task, we observed a reduction in perplexity of about 25%, and a reduction in average error rate of about 15%.\n",

In this study, we update the duration parameters along with other model parameters during discriminative training iterations. The convergence property of the training property based on the MSE approach is investigated, and experimental results on wireline connected digit recognition task demonstrated a 6% word error rate reduction by using the newly trained duration model parameters as compared to fixed duartion parameters during MSE training.\n",

Our techniques allow us to integrate Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a word-similarity algorithm based on word co-occurrence information, with N-gram models. While LSA is good at predicting content words which are coherent with the rest of a text, it is a bad predictor of frequent words, has a low dynamic range, and is inaccurate when combined linearly with N-grams. We show that modifying the dynamic range, applying a per-word confidence metric, and using geometric rather than linear combinations with N-grams produces a more robust language model which has a lower perplexity on a Wall Street Journal test-set than a baseline N-gram model.\n",

We present a variation of bi-pos language model where two tag sets are defined and assigned to each word (multi-tagged model) using grammatical information. Each tag set is based on different context behavior. We use linguistic expert knowledge and a simple automatic clustering procedure to obtain groups of words with similar left context behavior (first set of tags) and with similar right context (second set of tags).

Cluster trees, similar to parse trees, are constructed from the learned cluster rules. This hierarchical clustering adds grammatical structure onto a traditional trigram language model. The learned cluster rules are used to rescore and improve the n-best utterance hypothesis list which is output by a speech recognizer based on acoustic and trigram language model scores. Our hierarchical cluster language model was trained on TREC broadcast news data from 1995 and 1996, and reduced word error rate on the HUB-4 1997 broadcast news development set by 0.3% absolute. Prior symbolic knowledge in the form of rules can also be incorporated by simply applying the rules to the training data before the applicable learning iteration.\n",

It is based on a weighted mixture of long-term news scripts and latest scripts as training data. The mixture weights are given by the EM algorithm for linear interpolation and then normalized by their text sizes. Not only n-grams but also the vocabulary are updated by the latest news. We call it the Time Dependent Language Model (TDLM). It achieved a 4.4% reduction in perplexity and 0.7% improvement in word accuracy over the baseline language model. The second technique is correction of the decoded transcriptions by their corresponding electronic draft scripts. The corresponding drafts are found by using a sentence similarity measure between them. Parts to be considered as recognition errors are replaced with the original drafts. This post-correction led to a 6.7% improvement in word accuracy.\n",

    "Three cross-language ASR experiments which use hidden Markov modelling are described. Their goal is to process the signal so that it better exploits its linguistically relevant properties for consonant identification. Experiment 1 shows that consonant identification improves when vowel transitions are used. Particularly the consonants' place of articulation is identified better, because the vowel transitions contain formant trajectories which depend on the consonant's place of articulation. Experiment 2 shows that mapping acoustic parameters onto phonetic features before applying hidden Markov modelling greatly improves consonant identification rates. In experiment 3, the acoustic parameters from the vowel transitions are also mapped onto consonantal (not vocalic!) features (\"relational processing\"), as are the acoustic parameters belonging to the consonants. The additional use of vowel transitions does not further improve consonant identification, however. This is probably due to undertraining of the vowel transitions in the Kohonen network.\n",

We also demonstrated a phonetic recognizer and a word-spotter based on ANGIE. In this work, we extend ANGIE to a competitive continuous speech recognition system. Furthermore, given that ANGIE is based on a context-free framework, we have decided to combine ANGIE with TINA, a context-free based framework for natural language understanding, into an integrated system. The integration led to a 21.7% reduction in word error rate compared to a baseline word bigram recognizer on ATIS. We also examined the addition of new words to the vocabulary, an area we believe will benefit from both ANGIE and the ANGIE-plus-TINA integration. The combination reduced error rate by 20.8% over the baseline and outperformed several other configurations tested not involving an integrated ANGIE-plus-TINA.\n",

    "In French the pronunciations of many words change dramatically depending on the word immediately preceding it. The result of this phenomenon, known as \"liaison\", in an ASR system that does not model \"liaison\" is the requirement of unnatural pronunciation and much user dissatisfaction. We present, in this paper, the development of an acoustic model which takes into account the wide variability of word pronunciations caused by the liaison, the integration of this model into a French continuous speech recognition system and decoding results.\n",

    "In this paper we describe a novel approach to address the issue of different sampling frequencies in speech recognition. When a recognition task needs a different sampling frequency from that of the reference system, it is customary to re-train the system for the new sampling rate. To circumvent the tedious training process, we propose a new approach termed Sampling Rate Transformation (SRT) to perform the transformation directly on speech recognition system. By re-scaling the mel-filter design and filtering the system in spectrum domain, SRT converts the existing system to the target spectral range. New systems are obtained without using any data from the test environment. SRT reduces the word error rate from 29.89% to 18.17% given 11KHz test data and a 16KHz SI system. The matched system for 11KHz has an error rate of 16.17%. We also examine MLLR and MAP. The best result from MLLR is 17.92% with 4.5 hours of speech. Similar improvements are also observed in the speaker adaptation mode.\n",

    "In this paper, we address the issue of deriving and using more realistic pronunciations to represent words spoken in natural conversational speech. Previous approaches include using automatic phoneme-based rule-learning techniques, linguistic transformation rules, and phonetically hand-labelled corpus to expand the number of pronunciation variants per word. While rule-based approaches have the advantage of being easily extensible to infrequent or unobserved words, they suffer from the problem of over generalization. Using hand-transcribed data, one can obtain a more concise set of new pronunciations but it cannot be extended to unobserved or infrequently occuring words. In this paper, we adopt the hand-labelled corpus scheme to improve pronunciations for frequent multi and single words occurring in the training data, while using the rule-based techniques to learn pronunciation variants and their weights for the infrequent words. Furthermore, we experiment with a new approach for speaker-dependent pronunciation modeling. The newly expanded dictionaries are evaluated on the Switchboard and Callhome corpora, giving a slight reduction in word recognition error rate.\n",

    "When shifting by a few samples a speech signal, we have observed significant variations of the feature vectors produced by the acoustic front-end. Furthermore, these utterances when decoded with a continuous speech recognition system leads to dramatically different word error rates. This paper analyzes the phenomena and illustrates the well known result that classical acoustic front end processors including spectrum and cepstra based techniques suffer from time-shift. After describing the effect of sample sized shifts on the spectral estimates of the signal, we propose several techniques which take advantage of shift variations to multiply the amount of training that speech utterances can provide. Eventually, we illustrate how it is possible to slightly modify the acoustic front-end to render the recognizer invariant to small shifts.\n",

    "The performances of the demiphone (a context dependent subword unit that models independently the left and the right parts of a phoneme) and the triphone are compared. Continuous density hidden Markov modeling for both types of units is tested with the HTK software using decision-tree state clustering. The speech material is taken from the SpeechDat Spanish database, composed by continuous speech utterances recorded through the public telephone network. The training corpus is speaker and task independent. Two testing sets are tried: isolated words corresponding to speaker names, city names and phonetically rich words; and numbers of Spanish identification cards and dates. The main conclusion is that the demiphone simplifies the recognition system and yields a better performance than the triphone. This result may be explained by the ability of the demiphone to provide an excellent tradeoff between a detailed coarticulation modeling and a proper parameter estimation.\n",

    "Consider generating phonetic baseforms from orthographic spellings. Availability of a segmentation (grouping) of the characters can be exploited to achieve better phonetic translation. We are interested in building segmentation models without using explicit segmentation or alignment information during training. The heart of our segmentation algorithm is a conditional probabilistic model that predicts whether there are less, equal, or more phones than characters in the word. We use just this contraction-expansion information on whole words for training the model. The model has three components: a prior model, a set of features, and weights of the features. The features are selected and weights assigned in maximum entropy framework. Even though the model is trained on whole words, we effectively localize it on substrings to induce segmentation of the word to be segmented. Segmentation is also aided by considering substrings in both forward and backward directions.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a new bootstrap technique to build domain-dependent language models. We assume that a seed corpus consisting of a small amount of data relevant to the new domain is available, which is used to build a reference language model. We also assume the availability of an external corpus, consisting of a large amount of data from various sources, which need not be directly relevant to the domain of interest. We use the reference language model and a suitable metric, such as the perplexity measure, to select sentences from the external corpus that are relevant to the domain. Once we have a sufficient number of new sentences, we can rebuild the reference language model. We then continue to select additional sentences from the external corpus, and this process continues to iterate until some satisfactory termination point is achieved. We also describe several methods to further enhance the bootstrap technique, such as combining it with mixture modeling and class-based modeling. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through a set of experiments, and the results are discussed. Analysis of the convergence properties of the approach and the conditions that need to be satisfied by the external corpus and the seed corpus are highlighted, but detailed work on these issues is deferred for the future.\n",

Alternatively, an algorithm based on the Viterbi score (VS) is used. This VS algorithm converges more rapidly, but obtains less competitive models. We propose a new algorithm that only considers the k-best derivations in the estimation process. The time complexity per iteration of the algorithm is practically the same as that of the VS algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been proven with a part of the Wall Street Journal task processed in the Penn Treebank project. The perplexity of a test set for the VS algorithm was 24.22 and this value was 22.73 for the proposed algorithm with k= 3, which means an improvement of 6.15%.\n",

The first approach, the Gaussian Merging-Splitting (GMS) algorithm, uses Gaussian splitting to uniformly distribute the Gaussians in acoustic space, and merging so as to compute only those Gaussians that have enough data for robust estimation. We show that this method is more robust than our previous training technique. The second approach, called tied-transform HMMs, uses maximum-likelihood transformation-based acoustic adaptation algorithms to transform a small HMM to a much larger HMM. Since the transforms are shared or tied among Gaussians in the larger HMM, robust estimation is achieved. We show that this approach gives a significant improvement in recognition accuracy and a dramatic reduction in memory needed to store the models.\n",

Consequently, speech enhancement can be achieved through processing of the voiced and the unvoiced components separately.

The method is based on Hidden Markov Models and is in analogy with the usual implementation of HMMs in speech recognition.\n",

    "The choice of speech unit affects the accuracy, complexity, expandability and ease of adaptation of ASRs to speaker and environmental variations. This paper explores a method of subword modelling based on the concept of multi-phone strings. The motivation in using the longer duration multi-phone strings is to reduce the loss of contextual information, cross-phone correlation, and transitions. Multi-phone strings are an alternative to context-dependent phones and they include many of the syllables. An advantage of multi-phone units is the existence of more than one valid multi-phone transcription for each monophone sequence, this can be used to improve ASR accuracy. A particular case of multi-phone strings namely phone-pairs is investigated in detail. Experimental Evaluation on TIMIT and WSJCAM0 are presented.\n",

Factors influencing phonetic modification included phonetic context, prosody, part of speech, adjacent disfluency and individual speaker. 11% of the acoustic landmarks defining /t/ closure, /t/ release and vowel jaw opening maximum were not detectable in hand labelling. In a separate corpus, 59% of recognition errors involved grammatical or function words like conjunctions, articles, prepositions, pronouns and auxilliary verbs, and for 17 tokens of /tu/, half were misrecognized.

    "We describe two new techniques for reducing word lattice sizes without eliminating hypotheses. The first technique is an algorithm to reduce the size of non-deterministic bigram word lattices by merging redundant nodes. On bigram word lattices generated from Hub4 Broadcast News speech, this reduces lattice sizes by half on average. The second technique is an improved algorithm for expanding lattices with trigram language models. Backed-off trigram probabilities are encoded without node duplication by factoring the probabilities into bigram probabilities and backoff weights, and duplicating nodes only for explicit trigrams. Experiments on Broadcast News show that this method reduces trigram lattice sizes by a factor of 6, and reduces expansion time by more than a factor of 10. Compared to conventionally expanded lattices, recognition with the compactly expanded lattices was also found to be 40% faster, without affecting recognition accuracy.\n",

    "This paper describes how the performance of a continuous speech recognizer for Dutch has been improved by modeling pronunciation variation. We used three methods to model pronunciation variation. First, within-word variation was dealt with. Phonological rules were applied to the words in the lexicon, thus automatically generating pronunciation variants. Secondly, cross-word pronunciation variation was modeled using two different approaches. The first approach was to model cross-word processes by adding the variants as separate words to the lexicon and in the second approach this was done by using multi-words. For each of the methods, recognition experiments were carried out. A significant improvement was found for modeling within-word variation. Furthermore, modeling cross-word processes using multi-words leads to significantly better results than modeling them using separate words in the lexicon.\n",

    "Stochastic language models based on word n-grams require huge amount of training material especially for large vocabulary systems. Using n-grams based on classes much less training material is necessary and higher coverage can be achieved. Building classes on basis of linguistic characteristics (POS) has the advantage that new words can be assigned easily. Until now for POS-based language models class sets have usually been defined by linguistic experts. In this paper we present an approach where for a given number of classes a class set is generated automatically such that entropy of language model is minimized. We perform experiments on German medical reports of about 1.2 million words of text and 24000 words of vocabulary. Using our approach we generate an exemplary class set of 196 optimized POS-classes. Comparing the optimized POS-based language model to the language model based on 196 normally defined classes we get an improvement up to 10% in test set perplexity.\n",

    "Many of the pruning strategies used to remove less likely hypotheses from the search space in large vocabulary speech recognition (LVR) systems, have a peak search space many times greater than the average search space. This paper discusses two such strategies used within BT's speech recognition architecture, Step pruning and Histogram pruning. Two-tier pruning is proposed as a simple but powerful extension applicable to either of the above strategies. This seeks to limit the expansion of the search space between the prune and acoustic match processes without affecting accuracy. It is shown that the application of two-tier pruning to either strategy reduces peak search effort, and results in an average reduction in run time of 33% and 53% for step pruning and histogram pruning respectively, with no loss in top-N accuracy.\n",

    "Large vocabulary automatic speech recognition might assist hearing impaired telephone users by displaying a transcription of the incoming side of the conversation, but the system would have to achieve sufficient accuracy on conversational-style, telephone-bandwidth speech. We describe our development work toward such a system. This work comprised three phases: Experiments with clean data filtered to 200-3500Hz, experiments with real telephone data, and language model development. In the first phase, the speaker independent error rate was reduced from 25% to 12% by using MLLT, increasing the number of cepstral components from 9 to 13, and increasing the number of Gaussians from 30,000 to 120,000. The resulting system, however, performed less well on actual telephony, producing an error rate of 28.4%. By additional adaptation and the use of an LDA and CDCN combination, the error rate was reduced to 19.1%. Speaker adaptation reduces the error rate to 10.96%. These results were obtained with read speech. To explore the language-model requirements in a more realistic situation, we collected some conversational speech with an arrangement in which one participant could not hear the conversation but only saw recognizer output on a screen. We found that a mixture of language models, one derived from the Switchboard corpus and the other from prepared texts, resulted in approximately 10% fewer errors than either model alone.\n",

X-grams reduce perplexity with respect to trigrams and need less number of parameters. In this paper, the representation of the x-grams using finite state automata is considered. This representation leads to a new model, the non-deterministic x-grams, an approximation that is much more efficient, suffering small degradation on the modeling capability. Empirical experiments for a continuous speech recognition task show how, for each ending word, the number of transitions is reduced from 1222 (the size of the lexicon) to around 66.\n",

A set of Japanese phone HMMs are trained with ASJ (Acoustic Society of Japan) databases of 20K sentence utterances per each gender. Japanese word N-gram (2-gram and 3-gram) models are constructed with a corpus of Mainichi newspaper of four years. The recognition engine JULIUS is developed for assessment of both acoustic and language models. The modules are integrated as a Japanese LVCSR system and evaluated on 5000-word dictation task.

Therefore, the results presented in this paper are divided into two groups. The quantitative ones describe the performance achieved in terms of Equal Error Rates (EER) as a function of the field-test conditions and different limitations on the enrollment and test duration.

SALSA1.0 allows the user to speak English command words as well as partial or complete link names on any page. The research issues involved in building SALSA1.0 are mainly (1) how to handle large accent variations and mixed-language and (2) how to handle unknown words, especially proper names, in Web links. The recognition engine for SALSA1.0 is trained on WSJ data, and then retrained on a small amount of Hong Kong accent WSJ data to handle accent variations. An edit-distance algorithm is used to replace all unknown words by the closest known word in the word network for recognition. With these methods, link name recognition rate is at 91.20% for links without unknown words, and 82.40% for links with unknown words. SALSA is currently being developed into a multilingual, natural language-based Intranet service provider for HKUST campus information access.\n",

    "This paper describes an embedded Voice Interface Language (VIL) that enables the rapid prototyping and creation of applications requiring a voice interface. It can be integrated into popular script languages such as Perl or Tcl/Tk. Three levels of single-word commands enable the application designers to access basic speech processing technologies, such as automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech functions, without knowing details of the underlying technologies. VIL is a platform and domain independent speech application programming interface (API) that enables users to add a speech interface to their applications. The domain dependent components are defined by including a set of application specific arguments with each VIL command. Since the platform is an open architecture system, third party speech processing components may also be integrated into the platform and accessed by VIL.\n",

    "Previous research has found that using manually-operated mobile phones while driving significantly increases the risk of a collision. It has been suggested that automatic speech recognition (ASR) interfaces may reduce the interference between the tasks of phoning and driving. A laboratory experiment was designed to examine this hypothesis, and also to investigate the optimal design for in-car ASR systems. Forty-eight participants dialled phone numbers from memory while carrying out a concurrent tracking task. Tracking performance was found to be adversely affected while using a manual phone. This effect was significantly reduced, although not eliminated, with a speech phone. Participants also perceived the mental workload of manual dialling while driving to be greater than speech dialling. A system of audio feedback was found to be marginally preferable to combined audio plus visual feedback. The recognition accuracy of the ASR device did not appear to have any significant bearing on driving performance nor acceptance. The results are encouraging for the use of speech interfaces in the car for phone and other functions.\n",

    "Interactive information browsing of World Wide Web is a key application of the Internet and visual web browsers are widely used to access information. However, visual web browsing is not suitable in some circumstances such as in mobile environment. Therefore, we propose interactive listening to structured speech content for accessing information. Our proposed model of the interactive information listening services is that structured audio contents (HyperAudio) in a HyperAudio server are listened using a HyperAudio player whose appearance is similar to a portable radio. Unlike radio broadcasting programs, the HyperAudio contents have logical structures and hyperlinks so that listeners can listen desired information interactively. To put such logical structures into audio, a simple markup language was used. A prototype system of the HyperAudio server and players was implemented to test and evaluate feasibility and usability of the HyperAudio architecture.\n",

The prototype interface was evaluated to investigate how speech contributes to the interaction. The results showed that the subjects used a more optimal sequence of actions when using speech, and did fewer errors. We also present suggestions for future design of multimodal interfaces.\n",

    "This paper describes seMole (se-mantic Mole), a robust framework for harvesting information from the World Wide Web. Unlike commercially available harvesting programs that use absolute addressing, seMole uses a semantic addressing scheme to gather information from HTML pages. Instead of relying on the HTML structure to locate data, semantic addressing relies on the relative position of key/value pairs to locate data. This scheme abstracts away from the underlying HTML structure of Web pages, allowing information gathering to only depend on the content of pages, which in large part does not change over time. We use this framework to gather information from various data sources including Boston Sidewalk and the CNN Weather Site. Through these experiments we find that seMole is more robust to changes in the Web sites and it is simpler to use and maintain than systems that use absolute addressing.\n",

    "This paper describes an attempt to enhance a windows based (WIMP - Windows Icon Menu Pointer) environment. The goal is to establish whether user interaction on the common desktop PC can be augmented by adding new modalities to the WIMP interface, thus bridging the gap between todays interaction patterns and future interfaces comprising e.g. advanced conversational capabilities, VR technology, etc. A user survey was carried out to establish the trouble spots of the WIMP interface on the most common desktop work station, the Windows 95 PC. On the basis of this, a number of new modalities were considered. Spoken in- and output and gaze tracking were selected together with the concept of an interface agent for further investigation. A system was developed to control the interaction of the in- and output modalities, and set of five scenarios were constructed to test the proposed ideas. In these, a number of test subjects used the existing and added modalities in various configurations.\n",

In particular, we report on an ethnographic study of voicemail users, exploring the behaviors and needs of users of current voicemail technology. To constrain design choices for better technology, we then study how people navigate through audio and how they perform basic information processing tasks on a voicemail corpus. Observations and analyses from the user experiments lead to new principles of design for audio document interfaces, which are embodied in a prototype structural audio browser. Specifically, we conclude that the reinforcement of audio memory and appropriate definition of content-based playback units are important properties of interfaces suited to human audio processing behaviors.\n",

    "A person verification system based on voice and facial images has been developed within CSIRO Telecommunications and Industrial Physics, Australia, for use in low-to-medium security systems. It provides a unique ID, which is non-intrusive, fast, and has no need for memorising passwords. A stand-alone version of the voice verifier has an error rate of less than 8%, while the face verifier has an error rate of less than 5%. By combining the two modules, an error rate of less than 1% is achieved. This paper describes in detail the method and some of the important practical issues in the implementation of the voice verifier. It also addresses the issue of decision making if the two sub-systems produce contradictory results.\n",

    "This study analyses the possible use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for the automatic captioning of TV programs. Captioning requires: (1) transcribing the spoken words and (2) determining the times at which the caption has to appear and disappear on the screen. These times have to match as closely as possible the corresponding times on the audio signal. Automatic speech recognition can be used to determine both aspects: the spoken words and their times. This paper focuses on the question: would perfect automatic speech recognition systems be able to automate the captioning process? We present quantitative data on the discrepancy between the audio signal and the manually generated captions. We show how ASR alone can even lower the efficiency of captioning. The techniques needed to automate the captioning process are presented.\n",

Throughout the course, laboratory assignments based on the toolkit guided students through the process of creating a recognizer, while in-class lectures consistently referred to the architecture of the toolkit as a concrete example of an existing system. The class was organized so that lectures and laboratory assignments followed the steps taken in the creation of a new recognizer. The students first recorded and labeled their own corpus, then proceeded to design and train neural network based recognizers, before finally testing for performance and creating sample applications. As a final project, students performed simple, well-defined experiments using the recognizers they had constructed. The CSLU Toolkit is freely available for non-commercial use from http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/. In the future, similar courses based on the toolkit could be created and shared by many researchers in the speech community via the world-wide web.\n",

The performances of a VAD system with UV at various vocabulary sizes are studied. By rejecting 9.5% of correctly recognized names, the system error rate become less than 0.3% which represent a reduction of 91% in error rate over the baseline system.

    "This paper proposes a Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) system that teaches students how to write Japanese characters. The most important feature of the system is the usage of synthesized speech to interact with users. The CAI system has a video display tablet interface. A user traces a pattern of a character using the tablet pen, and simultaneously his tracing is shown on the display. When the trace line is outside the pattern, the system simultaneously outputs synthesized speech to correct the errors. To design strategies for generating instructions, behavior and instruction messages of a human teacher were recorded and analyzed. One of the most interesting challenges of the system is a function that changes the \"personality\" of the teacher, such as a strict teacher, a friendly teacher, and a short-tempered teacher. According to the experimental results, it was confirmed that the proposed system makes it possible to convey a particular impression using synthesized speech.\n",

    "Directory assistance systems are amongst the most challenging applications of speech recognition. Today, complete automation of the service fails because of the lacking accuracy of current speech recognizers, which are simply not able to differentiate between hundreds of thousands or even millions of different names occurring in large cities. In this paper, we show that this situation can be remedied by systematically combining all available knowledge sources (last names, first names, street names, partly including their spelled versions) in a statistically optimal way. Especially designed confidence measures for N-best lists are proposed to detect misrecognized turns. Applying these techniques in a hierarchical setup is judged as the enabling step for automating large scale directory assistance. In first experiments, we e.g. are able to service 72% of the inquiries for a database of 1.3 million entries with a remaining error rate of only 6% (or 62% with an error rate of 2%).\n",

The purpose of VPQ is to explore and exploit the capabilities of ``state-of-the-art'' speech recognition systems for this high-perplexity task, and to develop the natural language understanding and dialog control components necessary for effective and efficient user interactions. The VPQ task includes simple interactions, where the initial request is unambiguous and the system's response provides the desired information or completes a call to the requested person, as well as more complex interactions where ambiguities or errors require dialog-driven resolution. This paper highlights the inherent challenges in this task, the major components of the system, the rationale for their design, and how they perform.\n",

    "In this paper we present a speech understanding system that accepts continuous speech sentences as input to command a HIFI set. The string of words obtained from the recogniser is sent to the understanding system that tries to fill in a set of frames specifying the triplet (SUBSYSTEM, PARAMETER, VALUE). All circumstances (understanding incompleteness, HIFI set status, result of the command execution) are confirmed back to the user via a text to speech system with substitutable-concept pattern-based generated messages. The understanding engine is based on semantic-like tagging, including \"garbage\" tag, and context-dependent rules for meaning extraction. The system allows the application developer to follow the reasoning process (as every understanding rule has an associated concept pattern), spoken by the speech generation module. The concepts for speech generation are randomly substituted with alternative expressions having the same meaning to achieve a certain degree of naturalness in the response speech.\n",

The aim of the ESPRIT Multimodal Multimedia Service Kiosk (MASK) project was to pave the way for more advanced public service applications with user interfaces employing multimodal, multi-media input and output. The prototype kiosk, was developed after analysis of the technological requirements in the context of users and the tasks they perform in carrying out travel enquiries, in close collaboration with the French Railways (SNCF) and the Ergonomics group at UCL. The time to complete the transaction with the MASK kiosk is reduced by about 30% compared to that required for the standard kiosk, and the success rate is 85% for novices and 94% once familiar with the system. In addition to meeting or exceeding the performance goals set at the project onset in terms of success rate, transaction time, and user satisfaction, the MASK kiosk was judged to be user-friendly and simple to use.\n",

The signals to be captured and stored are the following: * Videoendoscopic images recorded with fibroscope or telelaringoscope. * Electroglottographic signal during fonation * Voice signal * Air flow signal All these different signals are recorded with specific transducers and standard digitalisation signal boards, using microphone input and input line simultaneously. Several systems to help in the diagnostic have been previously developed, but none of them captures the four mentioned signals simultaneously. All of them are highly interesting from the clinical point of view, and assist the expert in making the decision. The main advantage, related to other systems, is that looking at the videoendoscopic record, clinicians are able to label voice registers with the associated pathologies.\n",

    "The CSLU Toolkit is designed to facilitate the rapid development of spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications, as well as to provide a framework for conducting research in the underlying speech technologies. This paper describes the creation of a Mexican Spanish version of the CSLU Toolkit (both synthesis and recognition) undertaken at the Universidad de las Americas in Puebla, Mexico. Based on the Festival Speech Synthesis System of the University of Edinburgh, we have developed a complete concatenative text-to-speech system for Mexican Spanish, which is currently incorporated into the toolkit and includes both a male and female voice. In the area of recognition, we have created a set of task-specific Spanish recognizers for continuous digits, spelled words, and yes/no phrases, as well as a \"general-purpose\" phonetic recognizer suitable for arbitrary sub-domains. Using the Rapid Application Developer (RAD) component of the CSLU Toolkit, it is now possible to quickly prototype spoken dialogue systems in Spanish. The Spanish components of the CSLU Toolkit are freely available for non-commercial use from the following web page: http://info.pue.udlap.mx/~sistemas/tlatoa.\n",

    "The difficulty for non-native speakers in producing Japanese geminate stops with a long enough closure has been pointed out and extensively studied. However, the reverse problem exists for particular language speakers such as Chinese. For these speakers, production of Japanese intervocalic single stops sound like geminate stops. This study aimed to show acoustic evidence of this problem in the production of Japanese voiceless stops by learners of Japanese, and to compare speakers from different language groups, English, Chinese and French speakers. The results of the experiment indicated that since some of the stop productions by Americans and Chinese were too long for one mora unit, the Japanese heard a geminate (2 mora) instead of a single. Because French subjects had a small difference in the stop durations from the Japanese value, only a few of their productions of single stops were perceived as geminates. The language differences in timing pattern for Japanese stops were interpreted to reflect differences in timing implementation of native languages that is stress-timed and syllable-timed, at least concerning the difference between English and French speakers.\n",

The perceptual properties of Russians with regards to Japanese fricatives were examined. In the perception test, the confusion of [(omitted)o] with [so] was very large. This phenomenon could be caused by the difference between the transition onset time from [s'] to vowels and that from the other consonants to vowels. It is considered that, in the case of following vowel [a] and [o], Russians equated Japanese [s] and [(omitted)] with Russian [s] and [s'] respectively. However, in the case of [u], they did not equate them in such a manner. This is probably because the acoustic properties of Japanese [(omitted)] are very different from those of Russian [u].\n",

Three automatic measures were calculated, two LRs and rate of speech (ros), and then compared with the expert ratings. It appears that expert ratings of pronunciation quality can accurately be predicted on the basis of ros alone and that LRs do not contribute to better prediction. However, LRs can be useful to automatic pronunciation assessment because they can help detect fast speakers who produce totally wrong sentences.\n",

    "How can we provide feedback to second language (L2) learners about the goodness of their productions in an automatic way? In this paper, we introduce our attempts to provide effective feedback when we train native speakers of Japanese to produce English /r/ and /l/. First, we adopted spectrographic representation overlayed with formant frequencies as feedback. Second, we investigated the correlation between human judgments of L2 production quality and acoustic scores produced by an HMM-based speech recognition system. We also adopted the HMM-based scores as feedback in the production training. Evaluation of the pre- and post-training productions by human judges showed that production abilities of the trainees improved in both training groups, suggesting that both spectrographic representation and HMM-based scores were useful and meaningful as feedback. These results are discussed in the context of optimizing L2 speech training.\n",

    "Several experiments explored the contribution of visual information (lip movements) to spoken word identification by Japanese and Korean learners of English, and native speakers (NSs), and its interaction with sentence context, phonetic environment and, for learners, perceptual training (involving /r,l,p,f,theta,s/ using minimal pairs). The gating technique was applied to videotaped stimuli presented audiovisually (AV) or audio(A)-only to both groups. Stimuli were familiar, bisyllabic words beginning with the following visual categories: bilabial (/p/), labiodental (/f/), /r/, /l/, and nonlabials (/s,t,k/) combined with high, low and rounded vowels. Test (pretest--posttest), initial consonant-vowel (CV) sequence, modality of presentation (AV vs. A), and condition (context or excised word) were independent variables. Groups of NSs were presented with the same stimuli. NNS results revealed word identification was significantly earlier after perceptual training, in AV vs. A-only presentation, in context vs. excised word condition, and varied significantly with initial CV sequence. NS results also revealed significant effects of modality (earlier identification in AV vs. A-only), context, and initial CV sequence. Findings indicate the transfer of perceptual training from segment identification to the process of word identification in connected speech, and are consistent with a multiple-trace model of spoken language processing incorporating visual input.\n",

    "First and proficient second language users listened to a passage while concurrently performing a calculation verification task. The number of correct calculations achieved in the dual-task was compared to a single-task condition to index difficulty of language comprehension. Access to background knowledge was manipulated between participants by the presentation of a topic sentence. The difference between first and second language comprehension difficulty was greater when background knowledge was unavailable than when it was available. As each participant relied solely upon information from the speech signal for comprehension when the topic of the passage was not provided, it was concluded that the processes involved in decoding the speech signal generally consume more resources in second language than first language users.\n",

    "This study investigates the cross-language coarticulation patterns in Australian English and Japanese. F2 trajectories between the vowel target and vowel onset/offset in the context of /d/ were plotted and locus equations were fitted to the datapoints to capture the degree of coarticulation. Three talker groups were considered: native talkers of Australian English (AE), L2 English talkers (L1 Japanese, hence, JE) and native Japanese talkers (J). Two native groups AE and J clearly showed different coarticulation patterns between the alveolar stop and the adjacent vowels. There was some suggestion that /d/ is most resistant to coarticulation in AE, least in J, while JE talkers produced intermediate coarticulation values. The deviation of JE talkers' F2 trajectories from the AE group appeared more pronounced at the vowel offset than at the onset. Differences in coarticulatory patterns between native and L2 talkers may contribute to the perception of 'foreign (Japanese) accent' in the JE production.\n",

    "Audiovisual perceptual training of non-native phonetic contrasts was conducted for 10 naive Japanese adults using audiovisual recordings of 13 native English speakers articulating 90 rl minimal word pairs, and analyzed changes in perceptual and articulatory representations of non-native phonetic contrasts. The speech identification score drastically improved during the training. The improvement in non-native rl perceptual distinction was clearly associated with the changes in the perceptual and articulatory representations, which represents perceptual/ articulatory dissimilarities between the non-native and native phonemes as maps created using a multi-dimensional scaling analysis (MDS). Results suggested that the new non-native phonetic categories can be acquired through proper training even in adulthood so that distances among exemplars within each of the acquired categories shrunk and distances between the categories stretch considerably compared to those of pretraining stage in the perceptual and articulatory representations.\n",

    "Results from two experiments on acquisition of the word initial voicing contrast are compared, one on perception, one on production. Both involved monolingual and bilingual (French/English) subjects. Monolinguals are shown to have frequent disparities between their use of parameters in production and perception. Furthermore, bilingualism is found to affect subjects' production and their perception differentially, in a way which suggests that there cannot be isomorphism between their production and perceptual representations. However, the ongoing interference between the phonetic categories in bilinguals' two languages also argues that at the phonological level there is identity between cognates in their two languages. This pattern of phonological identity but phonetic difference is taken as support for models of speech processing in which distinct representations are attributed to phonology and phonetics, and to production and perception.\n",

This study aimed to investigate: (1) whether there would be age effects in the sharpness of categorisation; (2) whether sharpness of categorisation would differ across phonemic contrasts and (3) whether children aged 6 or more would give greater perceptual weighting than adults to acoustic cues characterised by rapid spectral change. Significant differences in identification function gradients were found between the 6;0-7;6 year olds and children aged 9;6 to 12;6, and between all children and adults. Sharper identification function gradients were obtained for stop place and voicing contrasts than for fricative place and voicing contrasts.

    "Assimilation of place of articulation across a nasal and a following stop consonant is obligatory in Japanese, but not in Dutch. In four experiments the processing of assimilated forms by speakers of Japanese and Dutch was compared, using a task in which listeners blended pseudo-word pairs such as ranga-serupa. An assimilated blend of this pair would be rampa, an unassimilated blend rangpa. Japanese listeners produced significantly more assimilated than unassimilated forms, both with pseudo-Japanese and pseudo-Dutch materials, while Dutch listeners produced significantly more unassimilated than assimilated forms in each materials set. This suggests that Japanese listeners, whose native-language phonology involves obligatory assimilation constraints, represent the assimilated nasals in nasal-stop sequences as unmarked for place of articulation, while Dutch listeners, who are accustomed to hearing unassimilated forms, represent the same nasal segments as marked for place of articulation.\n",

A database containing spontaneous speech utterances stemming from man-machine interactions in an automatic train-table inquiry system was used for this purpose. Pronunciation variants with and without /r/ were automatically generated on the basis of our specification of the phonological rule of /r/-deletion and were then included in the lexicon of a continuous speech recognizer (CSR) which was used in forced recognition mode. The results show that in a corpus containing 214,102 words, in which /r/-deletion could be applied 16,865 times, it was actually applied in 47.6% of the cases. This is a high percentage of occurrence for a phenomenon that has so sporadically been described. Furthermore, the results substantiate our rule specification: /r/-deletion occurs more often after schwa than after any other vowel.\n",

    "Cross-linguistic studies of the development of distinctive nasalization show evidence of significant suprasegmental conditioning. Amongst conditioning factors uncovered so far are vowel length and stress. Across languages it is reported that in the related contexts /V:N/ and /VN/, identical except for vowel length, phonologization of nasalization and N-deletion always occur preferentially in the context of long vowels. There is also cross-linguistic evidence of stress-conditioning of distinctive nasalization: nasalization and N-deletion appear to occur preferentially in stressed syllables. In this study, we discuss the results of an experiment designed to measure the possible effects of vowel duration and prominence on the perception of vowel nasalization. Both are seen to have an effect, although in different ways. Results presented here also lend support to the hypothesis that some sound changes, such as those involved in distinctive nasalization, may have a primarily perceptual basis.\n",

    "This report describes the development of a physiologically-based articulatory model, which consists of the tongue, mandible, hyoid bone and vocal tract wall. These organs are represented as a midsagittal quasi-3D layer with a thickness of 2 cm for tongue tissue and 3 cm for tract wall. The geometry of these organs and muscles are extracted from volumetric MR images of a male speaker. Both the soft and rigid structures are represented by mass-points and viscoelastic springs for connective tissue, where the springs for bony organs are set to extremely large stiffness. This design is suitable to compute soft tissue deformations and rigid organ displacements simultaneously using a single algorithm, and thus reduces computational complexities of the simulation. A novel control method is developed to produce dynamic actions of the vocal tract, as well as to handle the collision of the tongue to surrounding walls. Area functions are obtained for vowel sequences based on model's vocal tract widths in the midsagittal and parasagittal planes. The proposed model demonstrated plausible dynamic behaviors for human speech articulation.\n",

    "This paper examines the assumption that Australian English vowel variation within urban centres is restricted to Broadness variation and is a consequence of socioeconomic rather than regional factors. The acoustic structure of vowel realisations for subjects across three different regions in Sydney is compared to shed some light on the theory of regional uniformity. 95 adolescent female speakers of General Australian English produced multiple repetitions of 18 different vowels in the h-d context. The vowel formants for each group were compared using ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni. Results revealed several significant area effects not necessarily associated with broadness variation. As area often subsumes a range of socioeconomic factors, it was necessary to also investigate whether some other socioeconomic indicator would account for the results. An examination of parental occupation, education and area confirm area as the most important of these factors in influencing vowel realisation for this group of speakers.\n",

    "This study presents a kinematic and acoustic comparison of the vowels spaces of New Zealand English (NZE) and Australian English (AE). Five talkers of NZE (3F and 2M) and five female talkers of AE each produced between 9 - 15 tokens of the monophthongs in HEAD, HID,HAD, and HERD. For each token, measurements of lip aperture, lip protrusion, jaw height, and tongue height and backness were made, in addition to formants and vowel duration being calculated. There were three main findgs from this study. Firstly the widely held view that the NZE HID vowel may have lowered as it centralised may be incorrect. In this study results suggest that although the NZE HID vowel is retracted it remains a high front vowel. The second results is HERD is lip rounded in NZE and AE. The final finding is that there is no significant difference in vowel duration between NZE and AE HEAD and HAD, despite NZE HEAD and HAD being phonetically more raised. The implications of these results are discussed.\n",

    "Stops are not identified in the same way depending on preceding fricatives. According to Mann and Repp (1981), such context-dependent variations in the perception of stops originate from the influence of fricatives on how stops are produced. This study aimed further to explore this hypothesis. A first experiment showed that the effect of fricatives on the identification of stops tends to be confined to the most ambiguous stimuli, when a large range of acoustic cues to place of stop articulation is provided to the listener. In a second experiment, articulatory and acoustic data were gathered in the production of fricative-stop sequences. Although on the whole consistent with previous findings, our results indicate that many articulatory dimensions are brought into play in fricative-stop articulatory patterns, thus making it difficult to establish a direct link between the articulatory and perceptual levels.\n",

    "A large part of the variation in natural speech appears along the dimensions of articulatory precision / perceptual distinctiveness. We propose that this variation is the result of an effort to communicate efficiently. Speaking is considered efficient if the speech sound contains only the information needed to understand it. This efficiency is tested by means of a corpus of spontaneous and matched read speech, and syllable and word frequencies as measures of information content (12007 syllables, 8046 word forms, 1582 intervocalic consonants, and 2540 vowels). It is indeed found that the duration and spectral reduction of consonants and vowels correlate with the frequency of syllables and words in this corpus. Consonant intelligibility correlates with both the acoustic factors and the syllable and word frequencies. It is concluded that the principle of efficient communication organizes at least some aspects of speech production.\n",

    "We have devised a new class of fast adaptation techniques for speech recognition. These techniques are based on prior knowledge of speaker variation, obtained by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or a similar technique to T vectors of dimension D derived from T speaker-dependent models. This offline step yields T basis vectors called ``eigenvoices''. We constrain the model for new speaker S to be located in the space spanned by the first K eigenvoices. Speaker adaptation involves estimating the K eigenvoice coefficients for the new speaker; typically, K is very small compared to D. We conducted mean adaptation experiments on the Isolet database. With a large amount of supervised adaptation data, most eigenvoice techniques performed slightly better than MAP or MLLR; with small amounts of supervised adaptation data or for unsupervised adaptation, some eigenvoice techniques performed much better. We believe that the eigenvoice approach would yield rapid adaptation for most speech recognition systems.\n",

The various techniques are presented within a framework of top-down split-and-merge clustering. Since these schemes are to be used for MLLR-based adaptation, a natural evaluation metric for clustering is the increase in data likelihood from adaptation. Two types of cluster splitting criteria have been used. The first minimises a covariance-based distance measure and for the second we introduce a two-step E-M type procedure to form clusters which directly maximise the likelihood of the adapted data. It is shown that the direct maximisation technique produces a higher data likelihood and also gives a reduction in word error rate.\n",

    "In this paper, we examine the use of speaker adaptation in adverse noise conditions. In particular, we focus on incremental on-line speaker adaptation since it, in addition to its other advantages, enables joint speaker and environment adaptation. First, we show that on-line adaptation is superior to off-line adaptation when realistic changing noise conditions are considered. Next, we show that a conventional left-to-right HMM structure is not well suited for on-line adaptation in variable noise conditions due to unreliable state-frame alignments of noisy utterances. To overcome this problem, we suggest the use of state duration constrained HMMs. Our experimental results indicate that the performance gain due to adaptation is much greater with duration constrained HMMs than obtained with conventional left-to-right HMMs. In addition to the appropriate model structure, we point out that in long-term adaptation, such as incremental on-line adaptation, the supervised approach is a necessity.\n",

    "When performing speaker adaptation there are two conflicting requirements. The transform must be powerful enough to model the speaker. Second, the transform should be rapidly estimated for any particular speaker. Recently the most popular adaptation schemes have used many parameters to adapt the models. This paper examines an adaptation scheme requiring few parameters to adapt the models, cluster adaptive training. It may be viewed as a simple extension to speaker clustering. A linear interpolation of the cluster means is used as the mean of the particular speaker. This scheme naturally falls into an adaptive training framework. Maximum likelihood estimates of the interpolation weights are given. Furthermore, re-estimation formulae for cluster means, represented both explicitly and by sets of transforms of some canonical mean, are given. On a speaker-independent task CAT reduced the word error rate using very little adaptation data compared to a standard system. a speaker independent model set.\n",

    "This paper presents a novel framework of on-line hierarchical transformation of hidden Markov models (HMM's) for speaker adaptation. Our aim is to incrementally transform (or adapt) all the HMM parameters to a new speaker even though part of HMM units are unseen in adaptation data. The transformation paradigm is formulated according to the approximate Bayesian estimate, which the prior statistics and the transformation parameters are incrementally updated for each consecutive adaptation data. Using this formulation, the updated prior statistics and the current block of data are sufficient for on-line transformation. Further, we establish a hierarchical tree of HMM's and use it to dynamically control the transformation sharing for each HMM unit. In the speaker adaptation experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of proposed on-line transformation to other method.\n",

    "Speaker normalization is a process in which the short-time features of speech from a given speaker are transformed so as to better match some speaker independent model. Vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) is a popular speaker normalization scheme wherein the frequency axis of the short-time spectrum associated with a speaker's speech is rescaled or warped prior to the extraction of cepstral features. In this work, we develop a novel speaker normalization scheme by exploiting the fact that frequency domain transformations similar to that inherent in VTLN can be accomplished entirely in the cepstral domain through the use of conformal maps. We propose a class of such maps, designated all-pass transforms for reasons given hereafter, and in a set of speech recognition experiments conducted on the Switchboard Corpus demonstrate their capacity to achieve word error rate reductions of 3.7% absolute.\n",

    "When using interactive systems, people adapt their speech during attempts to resolve system recognition errors. This paper summarizes the two-stage Computer-elicited Hyperarticulate Adaptation Model (CHAM), which accounts for systematic changes in human speech during interactive error handling. According to CHAM, Stage I adaptation is manifest as a singular change involving the increased duration of speech and pauses. This change is associated with a moderate degree of hyperarticulation, which occurs during a low rate of system errors. In contrast, State II adaptations are associated with more extreme hyperarticulation during a high system error rate. It entails change in multiple features of speech - including duration, articulation, intonation pattern, fundamental frequency and amplitude. This paper summarizes the empirical findings and linguistic theory upon which CHAM is based, as well as the model's main predictions. Finally, the implications of CHAM are discussed for designing future interactive systems with improved error handling.\n",

We performed adaptation on single speakers and speaker groups built from combinations of spoken and native language. Furthermore, we performed retraining on partitions of the adaptation or training data. Our experiments led to an error rate reduction in all cases: compared to the baseline system, we achieved an overall improvement of 14, 12--14 and 7 % for speaker adaptation, speaker group adaptation and retraining, respectively. Furthermore, we found among others that performance is rather stable for Italian between adaptation and retraining, while adaptation for German outperforms retraining by far.\n",

This project at the University of Karlsruhe investigates LVCSR systems in 15 languages of the world, namely Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, and Turkish. Based on a global phoneme set we built different multilingual speech recognition systems for five of the 15 languages. Context dependent phoneme models are created data-driven by introducing questions about languages and language groups to our polyphone clustering procedure. We apply the resulting multilingual models to unseen languages and present several recognition results in language independent and language adaptive setups. The results indicate that the method of parameter sharing should be decided depending on whether multilingual or crosslingual speech recognition is projected.\n",

    "The problem addressed is automatically detecting, measuring and correcting nonnative pronunciation characteristics (so-called \"foreign accents\") in foreign language speech. Systemic, structural and realizational differences between L1 (native language) and L2 (target language) appear as phone insertions, deletions and substitutions. A bilingual phone recognizer using native-trained acoustic models of the learner's L1 and L2 was developed to identify insertions, deletions and substitutions of L2 phones. Recognition results are combined with knowledge of phonetics, phonology and pedagogy to show learners which phones were mispronounced and to instruct how to modify their articulatory gestures for more native-sounding speech. The degree of the learner's foreign accent is measured based on the number of alternate pronunciations the learner uses; the number decreases as learning progresses. Evaluation experiments using Japanese and American English indicate that the system is an effective component technology for computer-aided pronunciation learning.\n",

    "Fifty seven children with impaired hearing aged 4-12 years were evaluated with speech perception and language measures as the first stage of a longitudinal study. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) were used to evaluate the children's spoken language. Regression analyses indicated that scores on both tests were significantly correlated with chronological age, but delayed relative to children with normal hearing. Performance increased at 45% of the rate expected for children with normal hearing for the CELF, and 62% for the PPVT. Perception scores were not significantly correlated with chronological age, but were highly correlated with results on the PPVT and CELF. The data suggest a complex relationship whereby hearing impairment reduces speech perception, which slows language development, which has a further adverse effect on speech perception.\n",

The results show that the natives' scores on the fluency ratings and on the quantitative measures significantly differ from those of the non-natives, with the native speakers being considered more fluent.

    "High OOV-rates are one of the most prevailing problems for languages with a rapid vocabulary growth, e.g. when transcribing Serbo-Croatian and German broadcast news. Hypothesis-Driven-Lexical-Adaptation (HDLA) has been shown to decrease high OOV-rates significantly by using morphology-based linguistic knowledge. This paper introduces another approach to dynamically adapt a recognition lexicon to the utterance to be recognized. Instead of morphological knowledge about word stems and inflection endings, distance measures based on Levenstein distance are used. Results based on phoneme and grapheme distances will be presented. Our distance-based approach requires no expert knowledge about a specific language and no definition of complex grammar rules. Instead, grapheme sequences or the phoneme representation of words are sufficient to apply our HDLA-algorithm easily to any new language. With our proposed technique OOV-rates were decreased by more than half from 8.7% to 4%, thereby also improving recognition performance by an absolute 4.1% from 29.5% to 25.4% word error rate.\n",

    "ABSTRACT We study the effects of modeling tone in Mandarin speech recognition. Including the neutral tone, there are 5 tones in Mandarin and these tones are syllable-level phenomena. A direct acoustic manifestation of tone is the fundamental frequency (f0). We will report on the effect of f0 on the acoustic recognition accuracy of a Mandarin recognizer. In particular, we put f0, its first derivative (f0'), and its second derivative (f0'') in separate streams of the feature vector. Stream weights are adjusted to investigate the individual effects of f0, f0', and f0'' to recognition accuracy. Our results show that incorporating the f0 feature negatively impacted accuracy, whereas f0' increased accuracy and f0'' seemed to have no effect.\n",

    "Tests of foreign accent usually treat native listeners as reliable providers of accentedness ratings, and pay too little heed to task-specific effects on non-native speakers' performance. This paper details a number of factors which in fact influence native listeners' perceptions, and the native-like behaviour of non-native speakers' productions, based on the results of a large study of phonetic performance in second language learners. Listeners were observed to vary, at times considerably, in their perception of accent, depending on context, and type of stimulus, and at times showed distinctly idiosyncratic scoring patterns. Listeners' reactions to speaker voice pathology, mixed dialect pronunciation, and artefacts of read speech are discussed, and the effects of using different types of scoring system are examined.\n",

    "This paper reports on an exploratory study in which a group of second year secondary school pupils with reading ages ranging from 8.3 to 12.9 performed a set of tasks using the IBM VoiceType dictation package in order to determine the benefits of voice dictation for classroom use. The results showed that pupils with varying reading ages could dictate at comparable speeds and often with similar degrees of accuracy. Homophones were almost never a source of error in the texts produced with voice dictation, as compared with the children's handwritten texts. The implications of these findings for the use of dictation software in the classroom and for further studies of the potential of voice dictation for improving children's spelling and composition skills are discussed.\n",

    "We investigated English spoken word recognition of adult Japanese speakers. We found that the accurate recognition of the first syllable played an important role in recognizing a word correctly. It was implied that their recognition performance would be enhanced by time-scale expansion and/or dynamic range compression. The duration of a beginning word is so short that the listener can't recognize it correctly. In the first experiment, we found that they had difficulty in recognizing both isolated words and the extracted words, especially when the word did not begin with a strong syllable. In the second experiment, the extracted words and the corresponding time-scale expanded words were given. The result indicated that the expanded words were better recognized. It is found that the time-scale modification of the extracted words didn't lose intelligibility even around the ratio of 2.00, as was clear from the fact that the recognition improved.\n",

    "Children of three different ages (five, eight, and ten years old) were asked to syllabify a list of auditorily presented words. The list composition was such that the effect of different knowledge sources on the children's intuitive syllabification could be assessed: the relative importance of language-universal versus language-specific phonological constraints, the effect of morphological complexity, and the effect of orthographic knowledge. The results indicate that five-year old children are already aware of language-specific constraints and are sensitive to the phonological distinction between continuant and non-continuant consonants. Literate children (eight and ten years old) are influenced in their syllabification behavior by their orthographic knowledge, i.e. once children have reached the literate stage it is difficult for them to separate phonological and orthographic knowledge in this phonological task. Finally, children in all three age groups did not syllabify singulars differently than phonologically closely matched plurals.\n",

This result suggests that children acquire placing accent on the penultimate foot prior to retaining the lexical accent of the second element. We discussed a similarity between above result and a constraint-reranking phenomenon in adults' phonology. 3) The syllable, which plays a important role in adults' CA rules, does not contribute to the CA rules in children's phonology. We assumed that children have not acquired sufficient understanding of the syllable to contribute to the CA rules.\n",

    "This study demonstrated that the time-scale expansion of speech with the constant pitch (henceforth, expanded speech) enhanced the speech recognition of Japanese learners of English in contrast to the previous studies in which the time-scale expanded speeches did not contribute to the speech recognition chiefly because of the severe distortion of original speech and pitch change. Experiments were administered with the stimuli of original normal speech and the corresponding expanded speech. These results showed that the expanded speech stimuli were intelligible to many of the subjects. The hypotheses are that the expanded speech enhances listeners' speech processing and also enables the listeners to call into play virtual memory capacity for an on-line speech processing, which are more apparent in a longer stimulus. The expanded speech worked well with most subjects. Another prescriptions should be prepared for the rest of the subjects for whom the expanded speech was not solely much effective.\n",

Training class dependent LM and running them in parallel, LM can serve as classifiers with any kind of symbol sequence, e.g., word or phoneme sequences for tasks like topic spotting or language identification (LID). Irrespective of the special symbol sequence used for a LM classifier, the training of a LM is done with a manually labeled training set for each class obtained from not necessarily cooperative speakers. Therefore, we have to face some erroneous labels and deviations from the originally intended class specification. Both facts can worsen classification. It might therefore be better not to use all utterances for training but to automatically select those utterances that improve recognition accuracy; this can be done by a bootstrap procedure. We present the results achieved with our best approach on the VERBMOBIL-corpus for the tasks dialog act classification and LID.\n",

    "The atypical linguistic processing and cognitive development of previously institutionalised, adopted Romanian children are being researched using a neurolinguistic theory of development. Of particular concern is the Critical Period Hypothesis which holds that language capacity can only develop in response to relevant stimulation during a pre-determined period in childhood. The research impetus derives from the need to understand the course of first language acquisition in children who have suffered extreme deprivation at an early age. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to analyse what these children can tell us about the potential for language development in the face of such deprived circumstances. In order to examine this, a theory of neurolinguistic development will be applied to the case study of a formerly institutionalised Romanian child, Maria. A key question will be addressed: Has Maria's early deprivation set for her an irreversible path in terms of attaining normal language development?\n",

    "This paper proposes a novel architecture for language-independent ASR based on government phonology (GP). We use experimental data to show that phoneme-based recognisers perform poorly on languages other than the original target, rendering such systems inadequate for multi-lingual speech recognition, a result we attribute to the inadequacy of the phoneme as a linguistic unit. In the proposed GP model, recognition targets are a small set of sub-segmental primes, or \"elements\", found in all languages, which have been previously shown to be robustly detected in a language-independent manner. Well-formedness constraints are captured by simple parameter settings which can be easily encoded as rules and applied as top-down constraints in a speech recogniser. Hence, given a set of trained element detectors, a recogniser for any given language can in principle be rapidly built by selection of the appropriate lexicon and constraints. We describe the design of experimental architectures for our GP-based system.\n",

    "This single case study aims to combine the auditory assessment method with the precision offered by the instrumental measurement of acoustic characteristics, in order to investigate the phonetic aspect of early speech development, namely babbling and early words. While generic progress may be determined in the increasing prevalence of the number of CV syllables within the global repertory of utterances, the aspects that better reveal the influence of a target language include the frequency of occurrence of vowel types, especially if their classification refers to front-back dimension, in combination with an expansion and refining of phonotactic possibilities. Further, acoustic and articulatory evidence reveals an initial tendency for more control of height dimension than front/back. The patterns of C-V associations suggest that the child develops from a babbling phase characterized by the overwhelming prevalence of front articulations, to a phase characterized by the presence of the first words, where the patterns predicted by the MacNeilage and Davis theory occur, perhaps owing to the presence of the same patterns in the target lexicon.\n",

Acoustic analyses were carried out on two Swedish users of such a system.

    "Cochlear implants were initially distributed in Western countries. The speech processing strategies that have been developed to drive the implants provide detailed information about the spectral envelope and transients. This information is necessary to identify the phonemes of English and other Western languages. Cochlear implants have more recently been distributed in Eastern countries where tonal languages such as Mandarin and Cantonese are spoken. In addition to spectral envelope and transient information, tonal languages require finer resolution of pitch to distinguish different words. Speech processing strategies only provide the cochlear implant user with relatively low resolution of pitch. This study investigates the importance of voice pitch (F0) in detection of phonetically identical Cantonese words, which vary in pitch. Simulations of speech processing strategies were performed with a normal hearing subject and the results suggest that F0 is very important for correct identification of tonal words.\n",

    "This study describes the development of a test battery to assess high-level language function in Swedish and a description of the test performances of a group of 9 individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). The test battery included tasks such as repetition of long sentences, understanding of complicated logico-grammatical sentences, naming famous people, resolving ambiguities, recreating sentences, understanding metaphors, making inferences, defining words. The MS group included individuals with self-reported language problems as well as individuals without any such problems. Their performances were compared to a group of 7 control subjects with a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA which indicated significantly different total mean scores. Post hoc analysis with Mann-Whitney U-tests revealed that the group with self-reported language problems had significantly lower mean scores when compared to control subjects and to MS subjects without self-reported language problems. None of the language difficulties were detected by a standard aphasia test.\n",

    "Resolution of the fundamental frequency of speech sound required for the design of a speech processor of a cochlear implant device is investigated, with special regard to transmitting voice pitch information in Asian languages. Clinical application of the cochlear implant has spread rapidly in recent years to Asian countries where a variety of languages having different voice pitch information from English and other European languages are spoken. The perceptually acceptable area and required resolution of duration and fundamental frequency is estimated on a two-dimensional chart consisting of logarithmic time and frequency scales, based on the typical voice pitch contours of Japanese word accent and Chinese syllabic tone. As a result, it is shown that much finer quantizing and time sampling for the change in fundamental frequency is required compared with sentence intonation and emphasis common to other languages. It is also shown that the amount of information conveyed by combined use of lipreading with a cochlear implant is not sufficient for supplementing the voice pitch information. A possible way of transmitting such voice pitch information by transmission of the waveform of speech sound directly to the auditory area of cortex, where the waveform is reconstructed and voice pitch is extracted, is discussed.\n",

    "Past studies on Parkinsonian speech have generally examined the parameters of speech separately. Thus volume and suprasegmental duration have largely been described independently of each other on the assumption that two measures are not related. This assumption was tested by manipulating intensity and examining the corresponding effect on duration. Twelve Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and twelve normal healthy controls read according to three conditions; as softly as possible, as loudly as possible, and with no volume instruction (at normal volume). Total Duration of reading (with pauses), and Net Duration (without pauses) were examined. For Net Duration, both groups were similar, and did not vary across volume conditions. PD patients, however, demonstrated decreased Total Duration as speech volume was increased. The abnormal Parkinsonian relationship is suggestive of a trade-off between the two parameters in order to achieve adequately loud reading, and may be explained by increased attention associated with increased effort when speaking louder.\n",

Speech processor converts input speech into a series of stimulation electrode position and stimulation current intensities. This process can be optimized with a decomposing process of an acoustic signal into a given set of impulse responses corresponding to a set of electrode channels. An error minimization algorithm can find a optimal stimulation sequence that minimizes distortion of transferred speech and maximize transferred phonological information as well as sound qualities. Re-synthesized sound quality was qualitatively evaluated. Environmental sound can also be recognizable with this method.\n",

In an earlier study, NH, a group of normal hearing persons participated. This paper describes the results of two multimodal intelligibility tests with hearing impaired persons, where the additional information provided by a synthetic as well as a natural face is evaluated. In a first round with hearing impaired persons, HI:1, twelve subjects were presented with VCV-syllables and \"everyday sentences\" together with a questionnaire. The intelligibility score for the VCV-syllables presented as audio alone, was 30%. When adding a synthetic face the score improved to 55% and when instead adding the natural face it was 58%. In a second round, HI:2, fifteen hearing impaired persons were presented with the sentence material and a questionnaire. The audio track was filtered to simulate telephone bandwidth. The intelligibility score for the audio only condition was 57% correctly identified keywords. Together with a synthetic face it was 66% and with a natural face 83%. Answers in the questionnaires were collected and analysed. The general subjective rating of the synthetic face was positive and the subjects would like to use such a type of aid if available.\n",

Performance Scale IQ scores were slightly above the norm (106.3). Sentences scores were correlated significantly with language score (r = 0.49). Further investigation showed that the predictability of language scores could be improved when sensation level was taken into account. Sensation level was negatively correlated with language scores (r = - 0.51), demonstrating that children with better language abilities perceived speech at relatively lower intensity levels. The observed sensation levels from the group were compared with the expected levels for normally hearing children. This difference measure yielded a correlation coefficient of - 0.73 with language scores.\n",

    "Trying to understand the experimental data on segmentation of a speech signal by a principle \"Voice/Unvoice\" has led us to the hypothesis about a pair of logistical dependence between durations of these segments. The segmentation was carried out with the help of the computer program working in quasi real time. The hypothesis about logistic recurrent dependence for sequence of segments durations has allowed to make a conclusion about quasi rhythmical organization of this sequence. With the help of offered recurrent dependencies it is possible to explain statistical peculiarities of speech behaviour of stutterers in comparison with normal speech behaviour. These logistic dependencies were confirmed by direct experimental data. The assumption of origins of specified rhythm is made. These origins are hidden at the level of control of speech production and perception. Is shown, that the chaotic nature of offered dynamics of formation of large-scale temporary structure allows to enter concept of the information into consideration by a natural way.\n",

    "Visual perception of speech through spectrogram reading has long been a subject of research, as an aid for the deaf or hearing impaired. Attributing the lack of success in this type of visual aid mainly to the static form of information presented by the spectrograms, this paper proposes a system of dynamic visualisation for speech sounds. This system samples a high resolved, auditory-based spectrogram, with a window of 20 milliseconds duration, so that exploiting the periodicity of the input sound, it produces a phase-locked sequence of images. This sequence is then animated at a rate of 50 images per second to produce a movie-like image displaying both the time-varying and time-independent information of the underlying sound. Results of several preliminary experiments for evaluation of the potential usefulness of the system for the deaf, undertaken by normal-hearing subjects, support the quick learning and persistence of the gestures for small sets of single words and motivate further investigations.\n",

    "Contemporary psycholinguistic models suggest that there may be dual routes operating in phonetic encoding: a direct route which uses stored syllabic units, and an indirect route which relies on the on-line assembly of sub-syllabic units. The more computationally efficient direct route is more likely to be used for high frequency words, while the indirect route is most likely to be used for novel or low frequency words. We suggest that the acquired neurological disorder of apraxia of speech (AOS), provides a window to speech encoding mechanisms and that the disorder represents an impairment of direct route encoding mechanisms and, therefore, a reliance on indirect mechanisms. We report an investigation of the production of high and low frequency words across three subject groups: non-brain damaged control (NBDC, N=3); brain damaged control (BDC, N=3) and speakers with AOS (N=4). The results are presented and discussed within the dual-route phonetic encoding hypothesis.\n",

    "A sample of 209 adults ranging from 20 to 79 years of age were studied to measure speech communication profiles as a function of age in persons who did not identify themselves as hearing impaired. The study was conducted in order to evaluate age-related speech perception abilities and communication profiles in a population who do not esent for hearing assessment and who are not included in census statistics as having hearing problems. Audiometric assessment, demographic and hearing history self-reports, speech reception thresholds, consonant discrimination perception in quiet and noi , and the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired (CPHI) were the instruments used to develop speech communication profiles. Hearing performance decreased with increased age. However, despite self-reports of no hearing impairment, many subjects ov age 50 had audiometric thresholds that indicated hearing impairment. The responses to the CPHI were correlated to audiometric thresholds, but also to the age of the respondent, when hearing thresholds had been controlled statistically. A comparison of C I responses from this study and that of two other samples in clinical populations revealed only slightly different patterns of behaviour in the present sample when confronted with communication difficulties.\n",

An experiment is presented in which schwa is produced in symmetrical vowel and consonant contexts under varying speech rate conditions. It is shown that the contextual influence on schwa depends on its duration, a result that is not compatible with the concept of a targetless vowel.

    "This paper gives an overview and an analysis of representative vowel space depictions found in the phonetic literature of the past four centuries. A visual representation of 24 selected structural proposals with time is given in poster form, after translation to a common notation. A first-order approach is developed by which the distance between any pair of vowel schemes may be measured. Using these distances and other considerations, trends are detected and major innovations identified. An attempt is then made to trace the genealogy of five general phonetic concepts concerning the structure of vowel space: discretizing the continuum, the assumption of symmetry, triangular vs. square arrangements, the development of 'roundedness' as an independent dimension and the treatment of 'central' vowels. Such a historical perspective is deemed necessary for a full appreciation and utilization of the current vowel schemes.

In this paper we describe our attempt towards speech inverse mapping by using the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients to represent the acoustic parameters of the speech signal.

Anatomical landmarks are identified on computer images transferred from laryngoscopic videotapes, and measurements are taken of dimensions defined by the configuration of the pharyngeal articulators. Comparisons are taken across linguistically contrastive consonants and vowels, where the activity of the laryngeal sphincter accompanies tongue retraction and larynx raising, and implications are drawn for the measurement of voice quality settings.

    "Correspondence between the glottal opening gesture pattern and vowel devoicing in Japanese was examined using PGG with special reference to the pattern of glottal gesture overlap and blending into the neighboring vowel. The results showed that most of the tokens demonstrated either a single glottal opening pattern with a devoiced vowel, or a double glottal opening with a voiced vowel during /CiC/ sequences as generally expected. Some tokens, however, showed a double glottal opening with a devoiced vowel, or a single glottal opening with a partially voiced vowel. From the viewpoint of gestural overlap analysis of vowel devoicing, an intermediate process of gestural overlap may explain the occurrence of the case in which the vowel was devoiced and showed a double phase opening. Nevertheless, the presence of a partially voiced vowel with a single opening phase clearly shows the complexity of vowel devoicing in Japanese, since there are possibly two different patterns of glottal opening (single phase and double phase), which could be observed in PGG analysis, in utterances with partially voiced vowels.\n",

    "While English word accent is linguistically almost the same as Japanese one, the word accent acoustically differs between the two languages. This fact lets us easily suppose that Japanese learners tend to generate the word accent in a manner of not English but Japanese. We propose two methods for automating the detection of the generated word accent and the evaluation of how it is generated. By using context-sensitive HMMs, stressed and unstressed syllables were modeled separately for their structure and for their position in a word. In the matching process, weighting factors were multiplied with several likelihood scores derived from different acoustic parameters. The optimal combination of the factors for the detection can be thought to reflect each speaker's own manner of the accent generation. The analysis of the optimal combination showed different tendencies between Japanese and native speakers, which mainly accorded with findings in previous studies on English teaching.\n",

    "Data collected from Japanese and English showed that both phonetically fully voiced and (partially) devoiced allophones of /d/ have very similar perturbatory effect on the F0 of the following vowel. It is considered, therefore, that the phonetic voicing of /d/ (periodicity during the closure) is not clearly correlated with lower levels of F0 on the following vowel. Although the F0 perturbation may be caused by some aspects in the production of the preceding stop which is not necessarily manifested in actual vocal cord vibration, this result indicates that there is still a possibility that people may deliberately control the F0 of the following vowel as an additional cue to the phonological difference between voiceless and voiced stop consonants.\n",

Results of experiments revealed that the shortening in non-adjacent consonants is a subsidiary compensation process to maintain constant duration at the larger domain than the syllable. Based on these observations, an attempt at modeling speech timing is presented with the perspective that speech production system is a process having multiple simultaneous tasks and the optimal output is obtained by a compromise between their objectives.\n",

The speech material used in this paper were nonsense words of form /eCVCe/ (V: a, i, u, e, o, C: p, b, m). Subject were four adult males, all of them were native speaker of Japanese. In recognition of the consonant, consonant was more closely related with shape pattern than formant pattern.

    "For the representation of acoustic characteristics of three-dimensional vocal-tract shapes, it is necessary to consider the effects of higher-order modes. This paper proposes an acoustic model of the vocal-tract which incorporates the coupling of the higher-order modes, including both propagative and evanescent modes. A cascaded structure of acoustic tubes connected asymmetrically is introduced as a physical approximation of the vocal-tract. The acoustic characteristics, which are dependent not only on the vocal-tract area function but also on the vocal-tract configuration, can be investigated by the proposed model. Preliminary results of numerical computations for relatively simple configurations suggest that additional resonances at frequencies above 4.3kHz are formed by the propagative higher-order modes, while those at frequencies below 3 kHz are influenced by the evanescent higher-order modes. These results are also confirmed by the FEM simulations.\n",

MR images of the dental crown that contains a small amount of water were obtained using a dental crown plate. A 3-D FEM vocal tract model is formed so that the number of elements is 28686, the number of nodes is 7010, and a rigid wall constitutes the vocal tract wall. Results showed that the flow rate was high at the narrow space made between the upper central incisors and the tongue surface. An electric equivalent circuit for fricative consonant phonation was designed in consideration of the location of the noise source.\n",

The kinematic triphone model, which is constructed from articulatory data obtained in the experiments through the use of a magnetic sensor system, is characterized by three kinematic features for a triphone and intervals between two successive phonemes in the triphone. After extracting a kinematic feature for a phoneme in a given sentence, for each point on the articulator, the minimum-jerk trajectory which coincides with the extremum of the time integral of the square of the magnitude of jerk of the point is formulated, which requires only linear computation.

    "This paper presents a method for reconstructing 3D tongue surfaces during speech from 6 cross-sectional contours. The method reduces the dimensionality of the tongue surface and maintains highly accurate reproduction of local deformation features. This modification is an essential step if multi-plane tongue movements are to be reconstructed practically into tongue surface movements. Six cross-sectional contours were used to reconstruct 3D tongue surfaces and these were compared to reconstructions from 60 contours. The best set of 6 cross-sectional contours was determined from an optimized set of 6 midsagittal points. These points had been optimized to predict the midsagittal contour. Errors and reconstruction coverage for the midsagittal optimization were comparable to those resulting from an optimization over the entire surface, indicating this was an adequate method for calculating a sparse data set for use in reconstructing 3D tongue surface behavior.\n",

The data displayed an overall coarticulatory versatility, except for an absolute invariance in the labio-dental constriction point. For consonant types recruiting the tongue, the variance explained by the degrees of freedom of the model evidenced specific compensation strategies: tongue tip compensation betokened the common coronal status of the dental plosive and the post-alveolar fricative; whereas tongue dorsum compensation signed the dorsal nature of the velar plosive.\n",

    "Contemporary psycholinguistic models suggest that there may be two possible routes in phonetic encoding: a 'direct' route which uses stored syllabic units, and an 'indirect' route which relies on the on-line assembly of sub-syllabic units. The computationally more efficient direct route is likely to be used for high frequency words, whereas the indirect route is most likely to be used for novel or low frequency words. This paper presents some acoustic evidence that suggests that there may be dual routes operating in phonetic encoding. The data reported suggest that a group of normal speakers may be employing different routes in the phonetic encoding of high and low frequency words elicited via a repetition task. The evidence is presented and discussed within the framework of a dual-route hypothesis, and in light of other acoustic evidence reported in the literature.\n",

    "Many phonetic studies have shown that changes in speech rate have numerous effects at various levels of the temporal structure. This observation is reinforced by a verification with speech synthesis. Changing the number of syllables per second is not a satisfactory manner of creating natural-sounding fast or slow synthetic speech. A systematic comparison of sentences read at two speech rates by a highly fluent French speaker allows a ranking of various mechanisms used to slow down speech. Pausing and producing additional syllables transform the phonological structure of utterances since they impede interlexical binding. It is claimed that knowing the degree of this interlexical binding allows a better characterisation of speech rate changes, and then a better generation of synthetic rhythms. Finally, the expected relationship between lengthening of speech units and pausing was not confirmed in our results. This suggests that the theory on slowing down speech needs revision.\n",

We investigate the classification error rate (CER) of several classes of confidence measures and transformations based on a database containing 3345 utterances by 50 male and female individuals, employing data-independent and data-dependent measures. The transformations we investigated include mapping to single confidence measures, LDA-transformed measures, and other linear combinations of these measures. These combinations are computed by means of neural networks trained with Bayes-optimal, and with Gardner-Derrida-optimal criteria. Compared to a recognition system without confidence measures, the selection of (various combinations of) confidence measures, and the selection of suitable neural network architectures and training methods, continuously improves the CER from 16.7% to 6.6% (-60% relative). Furthermore, a linear perceptron generalizes better than a non-linear backpropagation network.\n",

In this system, discriminative training is used to optimize the parameters of the transformation function. In comparison to the baseline, experiments show that the proposed system reduces the equal error rate by 15%, with up to 40% false acceptance error reduction at various fixed false rejection rate. The combination of multiple features under the proposed framework is also discussed.\n",

    "This paper presents a new approach to measuring how confidently a word has been correctly recognized, or confidence measure. The approach consists of three major steps: (1) standard decoding; (2) forced Viterbi alignment (needed for stack decoders); and (3) rank-ordering of the subphone scores. More specifically, from the aligned sentence the third step computes the likelihood scores of the hypothesized subphone and all other competing subphones. A list of the subphones is generated in the descending order of the scores and a rank is assigned to the hypothesized subphone according to its positioning. Additional processing of selective weighting and upper-bound limiting is applied to minimize contamination of rank computations by bad segments or by highly-variable phones. The obtained rank is then used as the confidence measure. Results of word rejection experiments show that the new approach outperforms other measures such as whole-word scores by reducing the equal error rate from 32% to 20%.\n",

Instead of assuming task-specific lexical knowledge, our model is designed to characterize phrases depending on the speaking-style, thus can be trained with large corpora of different but similar tasks.

The dialogue-style dependent model trained with the ATIS corpus is used as a filler and shown to be effective in detection-based speech understanding on different dialogue applications. The lecture-style dependent filler model trained with transcriptions of various oral presentations also improves the verification of key-phrases uttered during lectures.\n",

    "The paper describes a new version of a visual feedback aid for speech training. The aid is a PC based speech processing system that visualizes incoming signal and its most relevant parameters (such as volume, pitch, timing, spectrum) and compares them to utterances recorded by reference speakers. The goal is to help a trained person in identifying the most severe deviations in his or her pronunciation. The learning through visual comparison is supported by displaying multiple reference utterances, including phonetic labels both to the reference speakers' and trainee's speech, indicating the areas with larger deviations in any of the displayed features and offering a simple tutoring assessment of the trainee's attempts. Primarily, the system was aimed at hearing-impaired users, but its features make it well applicable also for foreign language pronunciation learning and practicing. The latter possibility was verified in an experiment in which a group of subjects tried to learn pronunciation of a couple of words in an exotic for them foreign language.\n",

    "This paper describes a method of automatically synchronizing TV news speech and its captions. A news item consists of sentences and often has a corresponding computerized text, which can be used as a caption. We have developed a new phonetically HMM-based word spotter. In this word spotter, word sequences before and after a synchronization point are concatenated and scoring is based on the state of the synchronization point. The detection accuracy of the proposed method is shown to be superior to a conventional method using no word sequence pair. Model configurations are shown for detection failure, an announcer's misstatements and restatements, and erroneous transcriptions. A 100% detection rate with no false alarms is achieved by combining multiple word sequence pairs in series. A 100% detection rate with few false alarms is obtained by using model configurations for misstatements or erroneous transcriptions.\n",

    "This study investigated the ability to regulate speech volume in a group of six-volume impaired idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and their age and sex-matched controls. Participants were asked to read under three conditions; as softly as possible, as loudly as possible, and at normal volume (no volume instruction). The stimuli consisted of a target sentence, easily read in one breath, embedded in a short paragraph of text. Mean volume and volume over time (intensity slope) for the target sentence were obtained. It was found that for all three conditions, patients' speech volume was less than controls' by a constant. Patients also showed a significantly greater reduction of volume (negative intensity slope) towards the end of the sentence, especially for the loud condition. The findings indicate that patients with Parkinsonian hypophonic dysarthria have significant difficulty maintaining speech volume in addition to the inadequate generation of overall speech volume.\n",

    "Temporal effects of focus in Swedish were studied in short sentences with systematic variation of the length and prosodic pattern of target words in different syntactic positions. Generally, focus caused an average increase in word duration of about 25%. Variations of word length, stress, or word accent pattern did not produce any systematic effects on the amount of lengthening of the target word, but the lengthening varied considerably between speakers and different positions in the sentence. The most extensive lengthening occurred in combination with the insertion of a boundary after the word in focus in those cases when the word preceded a strong syntactic boundary. Within words, stressed syllables were lengthened most, and lengthening of a primary and following secondary stressed syllable was equal to that of a single primary stressed syllable. As unstressed syllables were also affected, the domain of focal lengthening is assumed to be the word.\n",

A ten minute corpus was hand segmented and labelled using six accent categories (i) unstressed (ii) word-initial (iii) emphatic word-initial (iv) word-final (v) intonation unit final before non-terminal boundary (vi) intonation unit final before terminal boundary. Results show that when different accent types and different speaking styles are taken into account there is no uniform lengthening of prosodic constituents in French, whether the syllable or some other suprasegmental unit is taken as the domain for lengthening. Instead differential lengthening is observed consistently with essentially greater lengthening towards the beginning of the syllable for initial prominence and greater lengthening towards the end of the syllable for final prominence. The degree of the different types of lengthening was moreover significantly different across the speaking styles.\n",

    "The prosodic features of filled pauses (fillers) and self-repair are investigated with a view towards the detection of disfluencies. First, we compare the prosodic features of typical fillers and their fluent homonyms using read sentences of identical phoneme sequences. It is confirmed that the fillers (1) have at least 2 times longer duration than their non-disfluent counterparts, (2) tend to be followed by definitely longer pauses, and (3) have much smaller movement in their pitch contours. Then, the spontaneous fillers segmented out from a dialogue corpus are also analyzed. The same tendency is confirmed, but some samples lie halfway between the read fillers and their fluent homonyms. The abruptly cut-off endings in the self-repair are also analyzed by comparing with the ordinary endings of words. It is found that a short phoneme ending coupled with a relatively short succeeding pause indicates the abrupt cutoff.\n",

But use this method directly must lead to unreliable parameter estimates for the number of parameters to be estimated may increase too excessively to limited train data. In this paper, we approximate the joint conditional PD by non-linear estimation method. The HMM incorporated temporal correlation by non-linear estimation method, which we called it FC HMM does not need any additional parameters and it only brings a little additional computing quantity. The results in the experiment show that the top 1 recognition rate of FC HMM has been raised by 6 percent compared to the traditional HMM method.\n",

    "It is widely claimed that close vowels in Japanese are devoiced when they occur between voiceless consonants. In this paper, voiceless vowels are represented symbolically as [V-] and voiced vowels as [V+]. The patterns of linguopalatal contact during C[V-]C units and the corresponding C[V+]C units are examined using the method of electropalatography (EPG). Our results show that C[V-]C units and the corresponding C[V+]C units often differ with respect to: (1) the amount (patterns) of tongue-palate contact from C1 (the preceding consonant) to C2 (the following consonant) and (2) the articulatory time interval from C1 to C2. Generally, the amount of linguopalatal contact is significantly greater at the front part of the palate in C[V-]C units compared to the corresponding C[V+]C units. The articulatory time interval from C1 to C2 is generally shorter in C[V-]C units compared to the corresponding C[V+]C units, though this is not always the case for all consonantal types. However, the articulatory gesture of the vowel appears to exist between voiceless consonants regardless of whether they are voiced or devoiced. Devoiced vowels have often been examined from the aspect of the opening gesture of the glottis since a turbulent noise during devoiced vowels is expected to be made at the glottis. However, our study seems to suggest that a turbulent noise can also be produced in the oral cavity - as well as at the glottis - by increasing the degree of tongue-palate contact. In principle, it is expected that the larger the tongue-palate contact is, the greater the turbulent noise will become due to the increased rate of airflow. This kind of linguopalatal contact appears to be a positive effort of a speaker rather than simply a matter of a shorter articulatory time interval in C[V-]C units: both factors seem to be related to the production of vowel devoicing, which seems to suggest that aerodynamic effects are involved.\n",

A sum of rational functions is encountered when the contributions from other HMM states are weighted in estimating Gaussian parameters of a state, and the weights are optimized using cross- validation. We will show that the growth transform of a sum of rational function can be obtained by computing term-wise gradients and term-wise function values, as opposed to forming first a single rational function and then applying the result in [Gopal91]. This is computationally advantageous when the objective function consists of many rational terms and the dimensionality of the domain is high.

This method can be used for verification of hypotheses about CSPs. The second approach - the bottom-up method -uses a constrained phone recognizer to generate phone transcriptions. An alignment was carried out between the two transcriptions and a reference transcription. A comparison between the two methods showed that 68% agreement was achieved on the CSPs. Although phone accuracy is only 63%, the bottom-up approach is useful for studying CSPs. From the data generated using the bottom-up method, indications of which CSPs are present in the material can be found. These indications can be used to generate hypotheses which can then be tested using the top-down method.\n",

Combining BPC recognition with text independent speaker recognition moves a bit in the direction of text dependent speaker recognition: a task which is known to reach better performance. The performance of BPC modelling is compared to our baseline system using ergodic 5-state HMMs. The question which BPC contains most speaker specific information is addressed. Also, it is investigated if and how the BPC alignment is correlated with the state alignment from the baseline system to check the assumption that states of an ergodic HMM can model broad phonetic classes.\n",

This is obtained with the prosody generator, which uses a series of phonological patterns for phonic groups and a grammatical database to vary three speech parameters: pitch, amplitude and duration. This system accepts plain text, which can be complemented with data about emotions and emphasis.\n",

    "Collections of speech documents can be searched using speech retrieval, where the documents are processed by a speech recogniser to give text that can be searched by text retrieval techniques. We investigated the use of a phoneme-based recogniser to obtain phoneme sequences. We found that phoneme recognition is worse than word recognition, because of lack of context and difficulty in phoneme boundary detection. Comparing the transcriptions of two different phoneme-based recogniser, we found that the effects of training using well-defined phoneme data, the lack of a language model, and lack of a context-dependent model affected recognition performance. Retrieval using trigrams performed better than quadgrams because the longer n-gram features contained too many transcription errors. Comparing the phonetic transcriptions from a word recogniser to that from a phoneme recogniser, we found that using 61 phones modelled with an algorithmic approach were better than using 40 phones modelled with a dictionary approach.\n",

    "This study deals with listeners' ability to identify linguistic units from linguistically incomplete stimuli and relates this to the potentiality of vowel reduction in a word. Synthetic speech was used to produce stimuli that were similar to real words, but where the vowel in the pre-stress syllable was excluded. Listeners then performed a lexical decision test, where they had to decide whether a stimulus sounded like a word or not. The effects of the identity of the removed vowel and of features of the consonants adjacent to the removed vowel were then examined, as well as syllabic features. For type of vowel, lower word rates were found for words with the vowels /a/ and /o/, whereas words with nasals after the reduced vowel tended to result in higher word rates. Furthermore, words that still conformed to the phonotactic structure of Swedish after reduction got lower word rates than words that violated this, possibly because the conforming words are more eligible to resyllabification, which renders them as phonotactically legal nonsense words rather than real words.\n",

    "The purpose of this research is to investigate methods for applying speech recognition techniques to improve the productivity of off-line captioning for television. We posit that existing corpora for training continuous speech recognisers are unrepresentative of the acoustic conditions of television soundtracks. To evaluate the use of application specific models to this task we have developed a soundtrack corpus (representing a single genre of television programming) for acoustic analysis and a text corpus (from the same genre) for language modelling. These corpora are built from components of the manual captioning process. Captions were used to automatically segment and label the acoustic soundtrack data at sentence level, with manual post-processing to classify and verify the data. The text corpus was derived using automatic processing from approximately 1 million words of caption text. The results confirm the acoustic profile of the task to be characteristically different to that of most other speech recognition tasks (with the soundtrack corpus being almost devoid of clean speech). The text corpus indicates that application specific language modelling will be effective for the chosen genre, although a lexicon providing complete lexical coverage is unattainable. There is a high correspondence between captions and soundtrack speech for the chosen genre, confirming that closed-captions can be a useful data source for generating labelled acoustic data. The corpora provide a high quality resource to support further research into automated speech recognition.\n",

    "The delta coefficients are a conventional method to include temporal information in the speech recognition systems. In particular, they are widely used in the gaussian HMM-based systems. Some attempts were made to introduce the delta coefficients in the K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) HMM-based system that we recently developed. An introduction of the delta coefficients directly in the representation space is shown not to be suitable with the K-NN probability density function (pdf) estimator. So, we investigate whether the delta coefficient could be used to improve the K-NN HMM-based system in other ways. In this purpose, an analysis of the delta coefficients in the gaussian HMM-based systems is proposed. It leads to the conclusion that the delta coefficients influence also the recognition process.\n",

    "A novel technique for speaker independent automated speech recognition is proposed. We take a segment model approach to Automated Speech Recognition (ASR), considering the trajectory of an utterance in vector space, then classify using a modified Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and maximum likelihood rule. The system performs favourably with established techniques. Our system achieves in excess of 94% with isolated digit recognition, 88% with isolated alphabetic letters, and 83% with the confusable /e/ set. A favourable compromise between recognition accuracy and computer memory and speech can also be reached by performing clustering on the training data for the PNN.\n",

    "In contrast to conventional n-gram approches, which are the most used language model in continuous speech recognition system, the multigram approach models a stream of variable-length sequences. To overcome the independence assumption in classical multigram, we propose in this paper a hierarchical model which successively relaxes this assumption. We called this model: Mnv. The estimation of the model parameters can be formulated as a Maximum Likelihood estimation problem from incomplete data used at different levels (j in 1...v). We show that estimates of the model parameters can be computed through an iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A few experimental tests were carried out on a corpus extracted from the French ``Le Monde''. Results show that Mnv outperforms based multigram and interpolated bigram but are comparable to the interpolated trigram model.\n",

    "In second language input studies, speaking speed is regarded as one of the most influential factors in comprehension. However, research in this area has mainly been conducted on written texts read aloud. The present study investigated temporal variables, such as articulation rate and ratio and frequency of fillers and silent pauses, in three university lectures given in Japanese. It was found that the total duration ratio of fillers was as great as that of silent pauses. It also became clear that, for individual speakers, articulation rate and frequency of fillers are relatively constant, while frequency of silent pauses varies depending on discourse section. Of total pause ratio, pause frequency and articulation rate, the latter correlated best with listener ratings of speech speed. The findings suggest that spontaneous speech requires methods of speech speed measurement different from those for read speech.\n",

    "Vowel space data (A two dimensional F1/F2 plot) is of interest to phoneticians for the purpose of comparing different accents, languages, speaker styles and individual speakers. Current automatic methods used by speech technologists do not generally produce traditional vowel space models; instead they tend to produce hyper dimensional code books covering the entire speakers speech stream. This makes it difficult to relate results generated by these methods to observations in laboratory phonetics. In order to address these problems a model was developed based on a mixture Gaussian density function fitted using expectation maximisation on F1/F2 data producing a probability distribution in F1/F2 space. Speech was pre-processed using voicing to automatically excerpt vowel data without any need for segmentation and a parametric fit algorithm was applied to calculate likely vowel targets. The result was a clear visualisation of a speaker's vowel space requiring no segmented or labelled speech.\n",

    "Programs for testing and training of difficult vowel distinctions in American English were created for subjects to access via the Internet using a web browser. The testing and training data include many likely vowel confusions for speakers of different L1s. The training program focuses on one distinction at a time, and adjusts to concentrate on particular contexts or exemplars that are difficult for the individual subject. In the current study, 52 subjects participated in testing and 2 subjects participated in training. In the testing portion, results indicate that the L1 and the fluency level in English, as well as individual variability, have an effect on perceptual ability. In the training portion, subjects showed improvement on the contrasts on which they trained. Because these programs make extensive data collection over large populations and large distances easy, this method of research will facilitate further investigation of questions regarding second language acquisition.\n",

    "Over frames of short time duration, filtered speech may be described as a finite linear combination of sinusoidal components. In the case of a frame of voiced speech the frequencies are considered to be harmonics of a fundamental frequency. It can be assumed further that the speech samples are observed in additive white noise of zero mean, resulting in a standard signal-plus-noise model. This model has a nonlinear dependence on the frequencies of the sinusoids but is linear in their coefficients. We use subspace line spectral estimation methods of Pisarenko and Prony type to estimate the frequencies and use the results in voiced-unvoiced classification and pitch estimation, followed by analysis of the speech waveform into its sinusoidal components.\n",

The majority of the perceived pauses in the examined Swedish spontaneous speech material, 73%, occurred in one of the following positions: between sentences, after discourse markers and conjunctions, and before accented content words. There is a range of acoustic correlates of perceived pauses in spontaneous speech, such as silent intervals, hesitation sounds, prepausal lengthening, glottalization and specific F0 patterns. The acoustic manifestation of a pause, e.g. the duration of the pause and the F0 pattern associated with the pause, is to some extent dependent on the pause's position and function.\n",

    "Terms for voice quality or phonation types for use in normal speech often come from studies of pathological speech (laryngeal settings) and it is hard to describe voice quality, especially the variations of a normal voice. In normal speech we use different voice qualities both for linguistic distinctions in some languages, prosodically as a boundary signal, socially depending on social and regional variants and paralinguistically in attitudes and emotions. This paper shows some reference types of voice qualities, recorded by a trained phonetician, and their acoustic correlates. In a pilot study a male actor recorded four attitudinally neutral sentences using five different emotions which are being compared to his neutral voice. It is evident that voice quality, as well as rhythm and intonation, plays an important role in giving the impression of different emotions.\n",
