    "This overview article reviews the structure of a fully statistical spoken dialogue system (SDS), using as illustration, various systems and components built at Cambridge over the last few years. Most of the components in an SDS are essentially classifiers which can be trained using supervised learning. However, the dialogue management component must track the state of the dialogue and optimise a reward accumulated over time. This requires techniques for statistical inference and policy optimisation using reinforcement learning. The potential advantages of a fully statistical SDS are the ability to train from data without hand-crafting, increased robustness to environmental noise and user uncertainty, and the ability to adapt and learn on-line.\n",

    "The prosody of a sentence (utterance) when it appears in a discourse context differs substantially from when it is uttered in isolation. This paper addresses why paragraph is a discourse unit and discourse prosody is an intrinsic part of naturally occurring speech. Higher level discourse information treats sentences, phrases and their lower level units as sub-units and layers over them; and realized in patterns of global prosody. A perception based multi-phrase discourse prosody hierarchy and a parallel multi-phrase associative template were proposed to test discourse prosodic modulations. Results from quantitative modeling of speech data show that output discourse prosody can be derived through multiple layers of higher level modulations. The seemingly random occurrence of lower level prosodic units such as intonation variations is, in fact, systematic. In summary, abundant traces of global prosody can be recovered from the speech signal and accounted for; their patterns could help facilitate better understanding of spoken language processing.\n",

    "Speech can be represented as a constellation of constricting events, gestures, which are defined at vocal tract variables, in a form of gestural score. Gestures and their output trajectories, tract variables, which are available only in synthetic speech, have recently been shown to improve the ASR performance. We introduce a procedure to annotate gestures on natural speech database, a landmark-based time warping method. For a given speech, Haskins Laboratories TADA model is used to generate a gestural score and acoustic output, and an optimal gestural score is estimated through iterative time-warping processes based on landmark (phone) comparison.\n",

    "In human speech production, the voice source contains important non-lexical information, especially relating to a speaker's voice quality. In this study, direct measurements of the glottal area waveforms were used to examine the effects of voice quality and glottal gaps on voice source model parameters and various acoustic measures. Results showed that the open quotient parameter, cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and most spectral tilt measures were affected by both voice quality and glottal gaps, while the asymmetry parameter was predominantly affected by voice quality, especially of the breathy type. This was also the case with the harmonic-to-noise ratio measures, indicating the presence of more spectral noise for breathy phonations. Analysis showed that the acoustic measure H1-H2 was correlated with both the open quotient and asymmetry source parameters, which agrees with existing theoretical studies.\n",

    "A systematic framework for non-periodic excitation source representation is proposed for high-quality speech manipulation systems such as TANDEM-STRAIGHT, which is basically a channel VOCODER. The proposed method consists of two subsystems for non-periodic components; a colored noise source and an event analyzer/generator. The colored noise source is represented by using a sigmoid model with non-linear level conversion. Two model parameters, boundary frequency and slope parameters, are estimated based on pitch range linear prediction combined with F0 adaptive temporal axis warping and those on the original temporal axis. The event subsystem detects events based on kurtosis of filtered speech signals. The proposed framework provides significant quality improvement for high-quality recorded speech materials.\n",

    "Natural prosody is produced by an articulatory system to convey communicative meanings. It is therefore desirable for prosody modeling to represent both articulatory mechanisms and communicative functions. There are doubts, however, as to whether such representation is necessary or beneficial if the aim of modeling is to just generate perceptually acceptable output. In this paper we briefly review models that have attempted to implement representations of either or both aspects of prosody. We show that, at least theoretically, it is beneficial to represent both articulatory mechanisms and communicative functions even if the goal is to just simulate surface prosody.\n",

    "This work presents two new approaches for parameter estimation of the superpositional intonation model for German. These approaches introduce linguistic and paralinguistic assumptions allowing the initialization of a previous standard method. Additionally, all restrictions on the configuration of accents were eliminated. The proposed linguistic hypotheses can be based on either tonal or lexical accent, which gives rise to two different estimation methods. These two kind of hypotheses were validated by comparison of the estimation performance relative to two standard methods, one manual and one automatic. The results show that the proposed methods far exceed the performance of the automatic method and are slightly beyond the manual method of reference.\n",

    "Phonetic decision trees are a key concept in acoustic modeling for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Although discriminative training has become a major line of research in speech recognition and all state-of-the-art acoustic models are trained discriminatively, the conventional phonetic decision tree approach still relies on the maximum likelihood principle. In this paper we develop a splitting criterion based on the minimization of the classification error. An improvement of more than 10% relative over a discriminatively trained baseline system on the Wall Street Journal corpus suggests that the proposed approach is promising.\n",

A number of published models sit within this framework, including, semi-continuous HMMs, subspace GMMs and the HMM error model. A set of preliminary experiments illustrating some of this model's properties using CMLLR transformations from the canonical state to the context dependent state are described.\n",

    "Variational KL (varKL) divergence minimization was previously applied to restructuring acoustic models (AMs) using Gaussian mixture models by reducing their size while preserving their accuracy. In this paper, we derive a related varKL for exponential family mixture models (EMMs) and test its accuracy using the weighted local maximum likelihood agglomerative clustering technique. Minimizing varKL between a reference and a restructured AM led previously to the variational expectation maximization (varEM) algorithm; which we extend to EMMs. We present results on a clustering task using AMs trained on 50 hrs of Broadcast News (BN). EMMs are trained on fMMI-PLP features combined with frame level phone posterior probabilities given by the recently introduced sparse representation phone identification process. As we reduce model size, we test the word error rate using the standard BN test set and compare with baseline models of the same size, trained directly from data.\n",

    "One of the difficult problems of acoustic modeling for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is how to adequately model the wide variety of acoustic conditions which may be present in the data. The problem is especially acute for tasks such as Google Search by Voice, where the amount of speech available per transaction is small, and adaptation techniques start showing their limitations. As training data from a very large user population is available however, it is possible to identify and jointly model subsets of the data with similar acoustic qualities. We describe a technique which allows us to perform this modeling at scale on large amounts of data by learning a tree-structured partition of the acoustic space,and we demonstrate that we can significantly improve recognition accuracy in various conditions through unsupervised Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) training. Being fully unsupervised, this technique scales easily to increasing numbers of conditions.\n",

    "Hidden Markov Models are widely used in speech recognition systems. Due to the co-articulation effects of continuous speech, context-dependent models have been found to yield performance improvements. One major issue with context-dependent acoustic modelling is the robust parameter estimation of unseen or rare models in the training data. Typically, decision tree state clustering is used to ensure that there are sufficient data for each physical state. Decision trees based on phonetic questions are used to cluster the states. In this paper, conditional random field (CRF) is used to perform probabilistic state clustering where phonetic questions are used as binary feature functions to predict the latent cluster weights. Experimental results on the Wall Street Journal reveals that CRF-based state clustering outperformed the conventional maximum likelihood decision tree state clustering with similar model complexities by about 10% relative.\n",

These weights are then multiplied with the frame-level statistics for the decision trees and Gaussian mixture components of the next iteration system. The composite system uses a log-linear combination of HMM state observation likelihoods. We report experimental results on several broadcast news transcription setups which differ in the language being spoken (English and Arabic) and amounts of training data.

We compare our proposed approach to a number of other well known methods of combining feature streams or multiple LVCSR systems. Our experiments show that using exponential models to combine features results in a word error rate reduction of 0.5% absolute (18.7% down to 18.2%); this is comparable to best error rate reduction obtained from system combination methods, but without having to build multiple systems or tune the system combination weights.\n",

    "Generalized Discriminative Feature Transformation (GDFT) is a feature space discriminative training algorithm for automatic speech recognition (ASR). GDFT uses Lagrange relaxation to transform the constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) algorithm for feature space discriminative training. This paper presents recent improvements on GDFT, which are achieved by regularization to the optimization problem. The resulting algorithm is called regularized GDFT (rGDFT) and we show that many regularization and smoothing techniques developed for model space discriminative training are also applicable to feature space training. We evaluated rGDFT on a real-time Iraqi ASR system and also on a large scale Arabic ASR task.\n",

The second is node parallelization using high performance SIMD architecture of GPU with CUDA, suitable for CUDA enabled computers. We compare the speedup of both approaches by learning typically-sized network on the real-world phoneme-state classification task, showing nearly 10 times reduction when using CUDA version, while the 8-core server with multi-thread version gives only 4 times reduction. In both cases we compared to an already BLAS optimized implementation. The training tool will be released as Open-Source software under project name TNet.\n",

    "In unsupervised training of ASR systems, no annotated data are assumed to exist. Word-level annotations for training audio are generated iteratively using an ASR system. At each iteration a subset of data judged as having the most reliable transcriptions is selected to train the next set of acoustic models. Data selection however remains a difficult problem, particularly when the error rate of the recognizer providing the initial annotation is very high. In this paper we propose an iterative algorithm that uses a combination of likelihoods and a simple model of sense to select data. We show that the algorithm is effective for unsupervised training of acoustic models, particularly when the initial annotation is highly erroneous. Experiments conducted on Fisher-1 data using initial models from Switchboard, and a vocabulary and LM derived from the Google N-grams, show that performance on a selected held-out test set from Fisher data improves when we use the proposed iterative approach.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a novel boosted mixture learning (BML) framework for Gaussian mixture HMMs in speech recognition. BML is an incremental method to learn mixture models for classification problem. In each step of BML, one new mixture component is calculated according to functional gradient of an objective function to ensure that it is added along the direction to maximize the objective function the most. Several techniques have been proposed to extend BML from simple mixture models like Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model (HMM), including Viterbi approximation to obtain state segmentation, weight decay to initialize sample weights to avoid overfitting, combining partial updating with global updating of parameters and using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for parsimonious modeling. Experimental results on the WSJ0 task have shown that the proposed BML yields relative word and sentence error rate reduction of 10.9% and 12.9%, respectively, over the conventional training procedure.\n",

While the hybrid system improves the HMM system in the case of monophone HMMs, the performance of the triphone HMM model could not be improved by monophone LDMs, asking for the need to introduce context-dependency also in the LDM model inventory.\n",

One of the main claims against hybrid recognizers is the increased complexity for context-dependent phone modeling, which is a key aspect in medium to large size vocabulary tasks. In this paper, we investigate the use of context-dependent triphone models in a connectionist speech recognizer. Thus, most common triphone state clustering procedures for Gaussian models are compared and applied to our hybrid recognizer. The developed systems with clustered context-dependent triphones show above 20% relative word error rate reduction compared to a baseline hybrid system in two selected WSJ evaluation test sets. Additionally, the recent porting efforts of the proposed context modelling approaches to a LVCSR system for English Broadcast News transcription are reported.\n",

The proposed methods were evaluated on continuous phoneme recognition tasks.

To avoid this problem, most of techniques using duration information adopt two-pass and N-best re-scoring approaches. Meanwhile, we propose an algorithm using word duration models with incremental speech rate normalization for the one-pass decoding approach. In the proposed technique, penalties are only added to scores of words with outlier durations, and not all words need to have duration models. Experimental results show that the proposed technique reduces up to 17% of errors on in-car digit string tasks without significant increase in computational cost.\n",

The DBN is able to learn pronunciation variants as well as typical phoneme confusions of the BLSTM predictor in order to compensate signal disturbances.

A variety of techniques for Gaussian clustering and model refinement are discussed for the model restructuring. LVCSR experiments are carried out on Pashto language with up to 105 hours of training data.

Therefore, TVFM can be perceived as an implicit trajectory modelling technique. Two approaches for estimating the TVFM parameters are presented.

Parameter estimation and sequence inference in the DHCRF are carried out layer by layer. Note that the training label is available only at the final layer and the state boundary is unknown. This difficulty is addressed by using unsupervised learning for the intermediate layers and lattice-based supervised learning in the final layer.

The aim is to reduce the cost associated with porting a spoken dialogue system from one language to another by minimising the amount of data required in the target language. Since word-level semantic annotations are costly, Semantic Tuple Classifiers (STCs) are used in conjunction with statistical machine translation models both of which are trained from unaligned data to further reduce development time. The paper presents experiments in which a French SLU component in the tourist information domain is bootstrapped from English data. Results show that training STCs on automatically translated data produced the best performance for predicting the utterance's dialogue act type, however individual slot/value pairs are best predicted by training STCs on the source language and using them to decode translated utterances.\n",

    "In this paper we explore various techniques for topic detection in the context of conversational spoken dialog systems and also propose variants over known techniques to address the constraints of memory, accuracy and scalability associated with their practical implementation of spoken dialog systems. Tests were carried out on a multiple-topic spoken dialog system to compare and analyze these techniques. Results show benefits and compromises with each approach suggesting that the best choice of technique for topic detection would be dependent on the specific deployment requirements.\n",

    "In recent years machine learning approaches have been proposed for dialogue management optimization in spoken dialogue systems. It is customary to cast the dialogue management problem into a Markov Decision Process and to find the optimal policy using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Yet, the dialogue state space is large and standard RL algorithms fail to handle it. In this paper we explore the possibility of using a generalization framework for dialogue management which is a particular fitted value iteration algorithm (namely fitted-Q iteration). We show that fitted-Q, when applied to continuous state space dialogue management problems, can generalize well and makes efficient use of samples to learn the approximate optimal state-action value function. Our experimental results show that fitted-Q performs significantly better than the hand-coded policy and relatively better than the policy learned using least-square policy iteration, another generalization algorithm.\n",

    "This paper presents a novel algorithm for learning parameters in statistical dialogue systems which are modelled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The three main components of a POMDP dialogue manager are a dialogue model representing dialogue state information; a policy which selects the system's responses based on the inferred state; and a reward function which specifies the desired behaviour of the system. Ideally both the model parameters and the policy would be designed to maximise the reward function. However, whilst there are many techniques available for learning the optimal policy, there are no good ways of learning the optimal model parameters that scale to real-world dialogue systems. The Natural Belief-Critic (NBC) algorithm presented in this paper is a policy gradient method which offers a solution to this problem. Based on observed rewards, the algorithm estimates the natural gradient of the expected reward. The resulting gradient is then used to adapt the prior distribution of the dialogue model parameters. The algorithm is evaluated on a spoken dialogue system in the tourist information domain. The experiments show that model parameters estimated to maximise the reward function result in significantly improved performance compared to the baseline handcrafted parameters.\n",

This publication answers, to which extent it is possible to predict task completion and how existing approaches generalize for longer lasting dialogues. We compare the performance of two different modeling techniques: linear modeling and the new n-gram modeling. The study shows that n-gram modeling outperforms linear modeling significantly at later prediction points. From a comprehensive set of interaction parameters we identify the relevant ones using Information Gain Ratio. New interaction parameters are presented and evaluated.

Then, a dialog describes a path in the transducer model from the initial state to the final one. An automatic dialog generation technique was used in order to generate the dialog corpus from which the transducer parameters are estimated. Our proposal for dialog management has been evaluated in a sport facilities booking task.\n",

Second, the SDS developer is opened the possibility of designing several alternatives and of comparing visually his design choice performances. Third, a reinforcement learning algorithm is integrated to automatically optimise the SDS choices. The design/monitoring tool helps the SDS developers to understand and analyse the user behaviour, with the assistance of the learning algorithm. The SDS developers can then confront the different KPI and control the further SDS choices by removing or adding alternatives.\n",

    "In the Spoken Dialogue System literature, all studies consider the dialogue move as the unquestionable unit for reinforcement learning. Rather than learning at the dialogue move level, we apply the learning at the design level for three reasons: 1/ to alleviate the high-skill prerequisite for developers, 2/ to reduce the learning complexity by taking into account just the relevant subset of the context and 3/ to have interpretable learning results that carry a reusable usage feedback. Unfortunately, tackling the problem at the design level breaks the Markovian assumptions that are required in most Reinforcement Learning techniques. Consequently, we decided to use a recent non-Markovian algorithm called Compliance Based Reinforcement Learning. This paper presents the first experimentation on online optimisation in dialogue systems. It reveals a fast and significant improvement of the system performance with by average one system misunderstanding less per dialogue.\n",

We test different Dialog Act models and two Error Models against the same dialog manager and compare our results with those of real dialogs obtained using such a dialog manager in the same domain. Our results show on the one hand that finer Dialog Act models achieve increasing levels of accuracy with respect to real user behavior and on the other that data-driven Error Models make task completion times and rates closer to real data.\n",

The database was made by a field test in which naive users used a client-server music retrieval system with a spoken dialog interface on their own PCs. An N-gram model was trained from sequences that consist of user dialog acts and/or system dialog acts for two dialog classes, that is, the dialog completed the music retrieval task or the dialog incompleted the task. Then the system detects unknown dialogs that is not completed the task based on the N-gram likelihood. Experiments were conducted on large real data, and the results show that our proposed method achieved good classification performance. When the classifier correctly detected all of the task-incompleted dialogs, our proposed method achieved a false detection rate of 6%.\n",

    "In a spoken dialogue system, the major aim of spoken language understanding (SLU) is to detect the dialogue acts (DAs) of a speakers utterance. However, error-prone speech recognition often degrades the performance of the SLU. In this work, a DA detection approach using partial sentence trees (PSTs) and a latent dialogue act matrix (LDAM) is presented for SLU. For each input utterance with speech recognition errors, several partial sentences (PSs) derived from the recognized sentence can be obtained to construct a PST. A set of sentence grammar rules (GRs) is obtained for each PS using the Stanford parser. The relationship between the GRs and the DAs is modeled by an LDAM. Finally, the DA with the highest probability estimated from the speech recognition likelihood, the LDAM and the historical information is determined as the detected DA. In evaluation, compared to the slot-based method which achieved 48.1% detection accuracy, the proposed approach can achieve 84.3% accuracy.\n",

A robust detection method of these acoustic events is realized by combining BIC-based segmentation and GMM-based classification, with additional verifiers for reactive tokens. Subjective evaluations suggest that hot spots associated with reactive tokens are consistently useful while those with laughters are not so reliable. Furthermore, we investigate prosodic patterns of those reactive tokens which are closely related with the interest level.\n",

    "In our barge-in-able spoken dialogue system, the user's behaviors such as barge-in timing and utterance expressions vary according to his/her characteristics and situations. The system adapts to the behaviors by modeling them. We analyzed 1584 utterances collected by our systems of quiz and news-listing tasks and showed that ratio of using referential expressions depends on individual users and average lengths of listed items. This tendency was incorporated as a prior probability into our method and improved the identification accuracy of the user's intended items.\n",

    "Dynamic modeling of spoken dialogue seeks to capture how interlocutors change their speech over the course of a conversation. Much work has focused on how speakers adapt or entrain to different aspects of one anothers speaking style. In this paper we focus on local aspects of this adaptation. We investigate the relationship between backchannels and the interlocutor utterances that precede them with respect to pitch. We demonstrate that the pitch of backchannels is more similar to the immediately preceding utterance than non-backchannels. This inter-speaker pitch relationship captures the same distinctions as more cumbersome intra-speaker relations, and supports the intuition that, in terms of pitch, such similarity may be one of the mechanisms by which backchannels are rendered unobtrusive.\n",

    "We manually designed rules for a backchannel (BC) prediction model based on pitch and pause information. In short, the model predicts a BC when there is a pause of a certain length that is preceded by a falling or rising pitch. This model was validated against the Dutch IFADV Corpus in a corpus-based evaluation method. The results showed that our model performs slightly better than another well-known rule-based BC prediction model that uses only pitch information. We observed that the length of a pause preceding a BC is one of the important features in this model, next to the duration of the pitch slope at the end of an utterance. Further, we discuss implications of a corpus-based approach to BC prediction evaluation.\n",

Until recently, categorical perception of speech has exclusively been measured by discrimination and identification experiments with a small number of repeatedly presented stimuli. Experiments by Rogers and Davis have shown that using non-repeating stimuli along a densely-sampled phonetic continuum yields a more reliable measure of categorization. However, no analysis method has been proposed that would preserve the continuous nature of the obtained discrimination data. In the present study, we describe a method of analysis that can be applied to continuous discrimination data without having to discretize the raw data at any time during the analysis.\n",

Numerous psychoacoustic studies have shown that listeners differ in how they process complex sounds; some listeners focus on the fundamental frequency while others attend to the higher harmonics. The difference appears to have a neurological basis, expressed in a leftward (for F0 listeners) or rightward (for spectral listeners) asymmetry of gray matter volume in the lateral Heschl's gyrus. In our experiment we found that spectral listeners performed better in an emotion judgment task, which is what we expected based on the fact that the processing of emotional prosody is relatively right-hemisphere lateralized.\n",

Since hair follicle endings (mechanoreceptors) are used to detect air turbulence [2] we expected, and observed, that syllables heard simultaneously with cutaneous air puffs would be more likely to be heard as aspirated, but only among those with hairy an- kles. These results demonstrate that information from any part of the body can be integrated in speech perception, but the stim- uli must be unambiguously relatable to the speech event in order to be integrated into speech perception.\n",

    "Our goal is to automatically learn a perceptually-optimal target cost function for a unit selection speech synthesiser. The approach we take here is to train a classifier on human perceptual judgements of synthetic speech. The output of the classifier is used to make a simple three-way distinction rather than to estimate a continuously-valued cost.In order to collect the necessary perceptual data, we synthesised 145,137 short sentences with the usual target cost switched off, so that the search was driven by the join cost only. We then selected the 7200 sentences with the best joins and asked 60 listeners to judge them, providing their ratings for each syllable. From this, we derived a rating for each demiphone. Using as input the same context features employed in our conventional target cost function, we trained a classifier on these human perceptual ratings.We synthesised two sets of test sentences with both our standard target cost and the new target cost based on the classifier. A/B preference tests showed that the classifier-based target cost, which was learned completely automatically from modest amounts of perceptual data, is almost as good as our carefully- and expertly-tuned standard target cost.\n",

For SVM training, a set of synthetic speech are firstly generated by a given speech synthesis system and their synthetic errors are labeled by manually annotating the segments that sound unnatural. Then, two context-dependent acoustic models are trained using the natural and unnatural segments of labeled synthetic speech respectively. The log likelihood ratio of acoustic features between these two models is adopted to train the SVM classifier for error detection. Experimental results show the proposed method is effective in detecting the errors of pitch contour within a word for a Mandarin speech synthesis system. The proposed SVM method using log likelihood ratio between context-dependent acoustic models outperforms the SVM classifier trained on acoustic features directly.\n",

Consequently, we propose to use robust Viterbi algorithm that can simultaneously detect bad units and select the best sequence.

If unintended stress patterns can be detected following unit selection, based on features available in the unit database, it may be possible to modify the units during waveform synthesis to correct errors and produce an acceptable stress pattern. In this paper, three machine learning algorithms were trained with acoustic measurements from natural utterances and corresponding stress patterns: CART, SVM and MaxEnt. Our experimental results showed that MaxEnt performs the best (83.3% for 3-syllable words, 88.7% for 4-syllable words correctly classified) in the natural stress pattern classification. Though classification rates are good, a large number of false alarms are produced. However, there is some indication that signal modifications based on false positives do little harm to the speech output.\n",

    "The paper describes the optimisation of Viterbi search used in unit selection TTS, since with a large speech corpus necessary to achieve a high level of naturalness, the performace still suffers. To improve the search speed, the combination of sophisticated stopping schemes and pruning thresholds is employed into the baseline search. The optimised search is, moreover, extremely flexible in configuration, requiring only three intuitively comprehensible coefficients to be set. This provides the means for tuning the search depending on device resources, while it allows reaching significant performance increase. To illustrate it, several configuration scenarios, with speed--up ranging from 6 to 58 times, are presented. Their impact on speech quality is verified by CCR listening test, taking into account only the phrases with the highest number of differences when compared to the baseline search.\n",

    "This paper describes a new approach to pitch marking. Unlike other approaches that use the same combination of features for the whole signal, we take into account the signal properties and apply different features according to some heuristic. We use the short-term energy as a novel robust feature for placing the pitch marks. Where the energy information turns out to be not suitable as an indicator we resort to the fundamental wave computed from a contiguous F0 contour in combination with detailed voicing information. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed pitch marking algorithm considerably improves the quality of synthesised speech generated by a concatenative text-to-speech system that uses TD-PSOLA for prosodic modifications.\n",

    "French is known to be a language with major pronunciation irregularities at word endings with consonants. Particularly, the well-known phonetic phenomenon called Liaison is one of the major issues for French phonetizers. Rule-based methods have been used to solve these issues. Yet, the current models still produce a great number of pronunciation errors to be used in 2nd language learning applications. In addition, the number of rules tends to be large and their interaction complex, making maintenance a problem. In order to try to alleviate such problems, we propose here an approach that, starting from a database (compiled from cases documented in the literature), allows us to build C4.5 decision trees and subsequently, automate the generation of the required rules. A prototype based on our approach has been tested against six other state-of-the-art phonetizers. The comparison shows the prototype system is better than most of them, being equivalent to the second-rank system.\n",

Therefore, a high-quality unit fusion method is proposed in this paper. More accurate pitch frame alignment and primary unit selection are implemented. Besides, the fusion of pitch frames is performed on FFT spectra for less quality loss.

A speech synthesizer must deal with the disfluencies in translations in order to be comprehensible and communicate the content. In this paper, we explore three synthesis strategies that address different problems found in translation output. By carrying out listening tasks and measuring transcription accuracies, we find that these methods can make the synthesis of translations more intelligible.\n",

    "This paper investigates the automatic detection of English spoken terms in a multi-language scenario over real lecture recordings. Spoken Term Detection (STD) is based on an LVCSR where the output is represented in the form of word lattices. The lattices are then used to search the required terms. Processed lectures are mainly composed of English, French and Italian recordings where the language can also change within one recording. Therefore, the English STD system uses an Out-Of-Language (OOL) detection module to filter out non-English input segments. OOL detection is evaluated w.r.t. various confidence measures estimated from word lattices. Experimental studies of OOL detection followed by English STD are performed on several hours of multilingual recordings. Significant improvement of OOL+STD over a stand-alone STD system is achieved (relatively more than 50% in EER). Finally, an additional modality (text slides in the form of PowerPoint presentations) is exploited to improve STD.\n",

    "A large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system usually utilizes a language model in order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm. However, the constraint also produces side-effects including low accuracy of the out-of-grammar sentences and the error propagation of misrecognized words. In order to compensate for the side-effects of the language model, this paper proposes a novel lattice generation method that adopts the idea from the keyword detection method. By combining the word candidates detected mainly from the acoustic aspect of the signal to the word lattice from the ordinary speech recognizer, a hybrid lattice is constructed. The hybrid lattice shows 33% improvement in terms of the lattice accuracy under the condition where the lattice density is the same. In addition, it is observed that the proposed model shows less sensitivity to the out-of-grammar sentences and to the error propagation due to misrecognized words.\n",

With the tool Direct Observation of Pruning Errors (DOPE), described in this paper, pruning errors are detected on the state hypothesis level, which is a very fine level of granulation, several orders of magnitude finer than the sentence level. This allows much more exact analyses, including the analysis of pruning methods, or the effects of pruning parameters.\n",

The objective function of the split optimization is augmented with a regularization term that measures the number of transducer states introduced by a split. We give results on a large spoken-query task for various n-phone orders and other phonetic features that show this method can greatly reduce the size of the resulting context-dependency transducer with no significant impact on recognition accuracy. This permits using context sizes and features that might otherwise be unmanageable.\n",

Firstly, as baseline decoding system, a dynamic lexicon-tree copy recognizer is developed, which aims to accelerate popular frame based recognizer, HTK. Steady segments, where the spectrum is stable, are extracted using landmark detection, and then detection results are provided to the following decoding module. At decoding stage, traditional inter-HMM token spreading framework is modified using steady segment knowledge, based on the observation that coexistence of steady frame and inter-HMM extension is impossible. Experiments conducted on Mandarin broadcasting speech show that the character error rate and run time achieve 22.1% and 5.24% relative reduction respectively.\n",

    "In automatic speech recognition, we are faced with a well-known inconsistency: Bayes decision rule is usually used to minimize sentence (word sequence) error, whereas in practice we want to minimize word error, which also is the usual evaluation measure. Recently, a number of speech recognition approaches to approximate Bayes decision rule with word error (Levenshtein/edit distance) cost were proposed. Nevertheless, experiments show that the decisions often remain the same and that the effect on the word error rate is limited, especially at low error rates. In this work, further analytic evidence for these observations is provided. A set of conditions is presented, for which Bayes decision rule with sentence and word error cost function leads to the same decisions. Furthermore, the case of word error cost is investigated and related to word posterior probabilities. The analytic results are verified experimentally on several large vocabulary speech recognition tasks.\n",

Our novel contributions for TCS are a pruning step during the recombination called Early Word End Pruning, an additional recombination technique called Context Recombination, the idea of a Startup Interval to reduce the number of started trees, and a mechanism to combine TCS with across word modelling. We show that, with these techniques, TCS can outperform WCS on a current task.\n",

Without a significant level of confidence, considerable computer resources are wasted since inaccurate recognition results are generated only to be rejected later. The technique proposed herein rapidly estimates the prior confidence based on just an acoustic likelihood calculation by using speech and context independent models before speech recognition processing; it then recognizes data with high confidence selectively. Simulations show that it matches the data selection performance of the conventional posterior confidence measure with less than 2% of the computation time.\n",

    "We present a novel continuous speech recognition framework designed to unite the principles of triphone and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modeling. The LSTM principle allows a recurrent neural network to store and to retrieve information over long time periods, which was shown to be well-suited for the modeling of co-articulation effects in human speech. Our system uses a bidirectional LSTM network to generate a phoneme prediction feature that is observed by a triphone-based large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder, together with conventional MFCC features. We evaluate both, phoneme prediction error rates of various network architectures and the word recognition performance of our Tandem approach using the COSINE database - a large corpus of conversational and noisy speech, and show that incorporating LSTM phoneme predictions in to an LVCSR system leads to significantly higher word accuracies.\n",

    "This study reports error detection experiments in large vocabulary automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, by using statistical classifiers. We explored new features gathered from other knowledge sources than the decoder itself: a binary feature that compares outputs from two different ASR systems (word by word), a feature based on the number of hits of the hypothesized bigrams, obtained by queries entered into a very popular Web search engine, and finally a feature related to automatically infered topics at sentence and word levels. Experiments were conducted on a European Portuguese broadcast news corpus. The combination of baseline decoder-based features and two of these additional features led to significant improvements, from 13.87% to 12.16% classification error rate (CER) with a maximum entropy model, and from 14.01% to 12.39% CER with linear-chain conditional random fields, comparing to a baseline using only decoder-based features.\n",

    "In this paper we propose a k-NN/SASH phoneme classification algorithm that competes favourably with state-of- the-art methods. We apply a similarity search algorithm (SASH) that has been used successfully for classification of high dimensional texts and images. Unlike other search algorithms, the computational time of SASH is not affected by the dimensionality of the data. Therefore, we generate fixed-length but high-dimensional feature vectors for phonemes using their underlying frames and those of boundaries. The k-NN/SASH phoneme classifier is fast, efficient, and could achieve a classification rate of 79.2% for the TIMIT test database. Finally, we apply this algorithm to rescore phoneme lattices, generated by the GMM-HMM monophone recognizer for both context-independent and context-dependent tasks. In both cases, the k-NN/SASH classifier leads to improvements in the recognition rate.\n",

    "This paper describes improvements in a search error risk minimization approach to fast beam search for speech recognition. In our previous work, we proposed this approach to reduce search errors by optimizing the pruning criterion. While conventional methods use heuristic criteria to prune hypotheses, our proposed method employs a pruning function that makes a more precise decision using rich features extracted from each hypothesis. The parameters of the function can be estimated to minimize a loss function based on the search error risk. In this paper, we improve this method by introducing a modified loss function, arc-averaged risk, which potentially has a higher correlation with actual error rate than the original one. We also investigate various combinations of features. Experimental results show that further search error reduction over the original method is obtained in a 100K-word vocabulary lecture speech transcription task.\n",

The second module is a Spoken Spanish generator from sign-writing composed of a visual interface (for specifying a sign sequence), a language translator (for generating a Spanish sentence), and finally, a text to speech converter. The system integrates three translation technologies: an example-based strategy, a rule-based translation method and a statistical translator.

    "Verbal interviews performed by trained clinicians are a common form of assessments to measure cognitive decline. The aim in this paper is to study the usability of automated methods for evaluating verbal cognitive status assessment tests for the elderly. If reliable, such methods for cognitive assessment can be used for frequent, non-intrusive, low-cost screenings and provide objective and longitudinal cognitive status monitoring data that can complement regular clinical visits and would be useful for early detection of conditions associated with language and communication impairments. This study focuses on two types of tests: a story-recall test, used for memory and language functioning assessment, and a picture description test, used to assess the information content in speech. A data collection was designed for this study involving recordings of about 100 people, mostly over 70 years old, performing these tests. The speech samples were manually transcribed and annotated with semantic units in order to obtain manual evaluation scores. We explore the use of automatic speech recognition and language processing methods to derive objective, automatically extracted metrics of cognitive status that are highly correlated with the manual scores. We use recall and precision based metrics based on semantic content units associated with the tests. Our experiments show high correlation between manually obtained scores and the automatic metrics obtained using eithermanual or automatic speech transcriptions.\n",

    "It is desirable to consistently and seamlessly update a language model of speech recognition without stopping it for online applications such as real-time closed-captioning. This paper proposes a novel speech recognition system that enables the model to be updated at any time even while it is running. It can run the second decoder with the latest model in parallel, and their priority that must be accessed is controlled at a non-speech portion by an additional job process, which sends acoustic features only to an active target decoder with the latest model and sends recognized words to the backend manual error correction for closed-captioning. The system seamlessly updates the model and ensures endless speech recognition with the latest model at any time. Our new practical real-time closed-captioning system reduced word errors by two thirds with the proposed language model update mechanism in the speech recognition and captioning experiments for Japanese broadcast news programs.\n",

In this paper, we propose a design principle of CAPTCHA, according to which the tasks should be designed so that the large difference of performance between the machines and human beings can be provided.

German models provided the best match with 54% of the data, 35% for English and only 11% for French models.

One way to help speech therapists treating patients would be to supply synthetic bench-marks for pathological speech. In a listening experiment testing perceived intelligibility, three types of manipulations of tracheoesophageal speech were evaluated by experienced speech therapists. It was found that modeling the intensity contour of the voice source signal improved speech quality over plain analysis-synthesis. Replacing the voicing source with fully synthetic source periods decreased the perceived intelligibility markedly. Making the source fully periodic with a regular pitch had no effect on perceived intelligibility. Low quality speech benefited more from manipulations, or deteriorated less, than high quality speech.\n",

In this latter case, it is not even possible to assume that one knows in advance the language being spoken. This is the context and motivation of the present work. We indeed investigate how current state-of-the-art speech recognition systems can be exploited in multilingual environments, where the language (from an assumed set of 5 possible languages, in our case) is not a priori known during recognition. We combine monolingual systems and extensively develop and compare different features and acoustic models. On SpeechDat(II) datasets, and in the context of isolated words, we show that it is actually possible to approach performances of monolingual systems even if the identity of the spoken language is not a priori known.\n",

In the verbal channel, these factors encompass requests for and production of vocal feedback, as well as lexical and grammatical mirroring. However, these cues are often subtle and culture-specific. Here, we present a preliminary investigation of the differences in elicitation and provision of vocal feedback across three diverse language/cultural groups: American English, Gulf/Iraqi Arabic, and Mexican Spanish. Based on a fully-transcribed and aligned sub-corpus of 80 interactions, we identify fundamental contrasts in production of vocal feedback. We identify dramatic differences in the rates of listener verbal feedback across the groups. However, we find both similarities and differences in the use of prosodic cues across these groups. These differences will inform the development of culturally-sensitive conversational agents.\n",

    "Nowadays, intelligibility is a popular measure of the severity of the articulatory deficiencies of a pathological speaker. Usually, this measure is obtained by means of a perceptual test, consisting of nonconventional and/or nonconnected words. In previous work, we developed a system incorporating two Automatic Speech Recognizers (ASR) that could fairly accurately estimate phoneme intelligibility (PI). In the present paper, we propose a novel method that aims to assess the running speech intelligibility (RSI) as a more relevant indicator of the communication efficiency of a speaker in a natural setting. The proposed method computes a phonological characterization of the speaker by means of a statistical analysis of frame-level phonological features. Important is that this analysis requires no knowledge of what the speaker was supposed to say. The new characterization is demonstrated to predict PI and to provide valuable information about the nature and severity of the pathology.\n",

    "Intra-session and inter-session variability in the Multi-session Audio Research Project (MARP) corpus are contrasted in two experiments that exploit the long-term nature of the corpus. In the first experiment, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) model 30-second session chunks, clustering chunks using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Cross-session relationships are found to dominate the clusters. Secondly, session detection with 3 variations in training subsets is performed. Results showed that small changes in long-term characteristics are observed throughout the sessions. These results enhance understanding of the relationship between long-term and short-term variability in speech and will find application in speaker and speech recognition systems.\n",

The acoustic models were adapted to the speaker, and then adapted to noise at a specified SNR. The match between subjective and recognition scores improved significantly when the adapted noise level and the tested level match. However, when SNR conditions do not match, the recognition scores degraded especially when test SNR conditions were higher than the adapted level.\n",

    "This paper analyzes the capability of multilayer perceptron frontends to perform speaker normalization. We find the context decision tree to be a very useful tool to assess the speaker normalization power of different frontends. We introduce a gender question into the training of the phonetic context decision tree. After the context clustering the gender specific models are counted. We compare this for the following frontends: (1) Bottle-Neck (BN) with and without vocal tract length normalization (VTLN), (2) standard MFCC, (3) stacking of multiple MFCC frames with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We find the BN-frontend to be even more effective in reducing the number of gender questions than VTLN. From this we conclude that a Bottle-Neck frontend is more effective for gender normalization. Combining VTLN and BN-features reduces the number of gender specific models further.\n",

    "This paper presents a computational model that can automatically learn words, made up from emergent sub-word units, with no prior linguistic knowledge. This research is inspired by current cognitive theories of human speech perception, and therefore strives for ecological plausibility with the desire to build more robust speech recognition technology. Firstly, the particulate structure of the raw acoustic speech signal is derived through a novel acoustic segmentation process, the `acoustic DP-ngram algorithm'. Then, using a cross-modal association learning mechanism, word models are derived as a sequence of the segmented units. An efficient set of sub-word units emerge as a result of a general purpose lossy compression mechanism and the algorithms sensitivity to discriminate acoustic differences. The results show that the system can automatically derive robust word representations and dynamically build re-usable sub-word acoustic units with no pre-defined language-specific rules.\n",

Firstly, we investigate a way to deal with the permutation-invariance property of the estimators when dealing with mixture models, while the second is derived by attaching a weakly informative prior over the space of speaker-level state sequences. Finally, based on the recently proposed segmental-BIC approach, we examine its effectiveness when mixture of gaussians are used to model the emission probabilities of a speaker. The experiments are carried out using NIST rich transcription evaluation campaign for meeting data and show improvement over the baseline setting.\n",

Multistream framework fits very well to such representation where different regions can be separately mapped into posterior probabilities of classes before merging. In this study, we investigated the effective ways of forming streams out of this representation for robust phoneme recognition. We also investigated multiple ways of fusing the posteriors of different streams based on their individual confidence or interactions between them. We observed an improvement of 8.6% relative improvement in clean and 4% in noise. We developed a simple yet effective linear combination technique that provides intuitive understanding of stream combinations and how even systematic errors can be leant to reduce confusions.\n",

Finally, these statistics are classified using agglomerative hierarchical clustering and a measure of dissimilarity between statistical distributions and the resulting clusters are analysed. The results show that there are systematic changes in spectral envelopes when going from neutral to sad or happy speech, and those changes depend on the valence of the emotional content (negative, positive) as well as on the phonetic properties of the sounds such as voicing and place of articulation.\n",

Based on it, we present a technique to find a low-dimensional decomposition of spectrograms by casting it as a problem of discovering independent non-negative components from it. The algorithm itself is implemented as regularized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Unlike other ICA algorithms, this algorithm computes the mixing matrix rather than an unmixing matrix. This algorithm provides a better decomposition than standard NMF when the underlying sources are independent. It makes better use of additional observation streams than previous nonnegative ICA algorithms.\n",

    "It is common in signal processing to model signals in the log power spectrum domain. In this domain, when multiple signals are present, they combine in a nonlinear way. If the phases of the signals are independent, then we can analyze the interaction in terms of a probability density we call the \"devil function,\" after its treacherous form. This paper derives an analytical expression for the devil function, and discusses its properties with respect to model-based signal enhancement. Exact inference in this problem requires integrals involving the devil function that are intractable. Previous methods have used approximations to derive closed-form solutions. However it is unknown how these approximations differ from the true interaction function in terms of performance. We propose Monte-Carlo methods for approximating the required integrals. Tests are conducted on a speech separation and recognition problem to compare these methods with past approximations.\n",

    "State-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems often combine outputs from multiple sub-systems developed at different sites. Cross system adaptation can be used as an alternative to direct hypothesis level combination schemes such as ROVER. In normal cross adaptation it is assumed that useful diversity among systems exists only at acoustic level. However, complimentary features among complex LVCSR systems also manifest themselves in other layers of modelling hierarchy, e.g., subword and word level. It is thus interesting to also cross adapt language models (LM) to capture them. In this paper cross adaptation of multi-level LMs modelling both syllable and word sequences was investigated to improve LVCSR system combination. Significant error rate gains of 6.7% relative were obtained over ROVER and acoustic model only cross adaptation when combining 13 Chinese LVCSR sub-systems used in the 2010 DARPA GALE evaluation.\n",

    "This paper describes a discriminative approach that further advances the framework for Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding. The approach introduces additional linear models for adjusting the scores of a decoding graph composed of conventional information source models, and reviews the WFST-based decoding process as a linear classifier for structured data. The difficulty with the approach is that the number of dimensions of the additional linear models becomes very large in proportion to the number of arcs in a WFST, and our previous study only applied it to a small task. This paper proposes a training method for a large-scale linear classifier employed in WFST-based decoding by using a distributed perceptron algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach was successfully applied to a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task, and achieved an improvement compared with the performance of the discriminative training of acoustic models.\n",

The paper compares GPU implementation of two techniques of acoustic likelihood computation: full Gaussian computation of all components and a significantly faster Gaussian selection method using hierarchical evaluation. The full Gaussian computation is an ideal candidate for GPU implementation because of its matrix multiplication nature. The hierarchical Gaussian computation is a technique commonly used on a CPU since it leads to much better performance by pruning the computation volume. Pruning techniques are generally much harder to implement on GPUs, nevertheless, the paper shows that hierarchical Gaussian computation can be efficiently implemented on GPUs.\n",

A hybrid purifying and clustering algorithm is used to cluster the summed channel speech into two speaker clusters. The GMM-SVM speaker recognition system is adopted to evaluate the performance with both MFCC and LPCC features.

We found that the moving averages of temporal information are effective in speaker recognition as well. The experiments on the 2008 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation dataset show the long-term and temporal information contribute to substantial EER reductions.\n",

    "The use of adaptation transforms common in speech recognition systems as features for speaker recognition is an appealing alternative approach to conventional short-term cepstral modelling of speaker characteristics. Recently, we have shown that it is possible to use transformation weights derived from adaptation techniques applied to the Multi Layer Perceptrons that form a connectionist speech recognizer. The proposed method - named Transformation Network features with SVM modelling (TN-SVM) - showed promising results on a sub-set of NIST SRE 2008 and allowed further improvements when it was combined with baseline systems. In this paper, we summarize the recently proposed TN-SVM approach and present new results. First, we explore two alternative approaches that may be used in the absence of high quality speech transcriptions. Second, we present results of the proposed approach with Nuisance Attribute Projection for session variability compensation.\n",

In this work, we use the subspace model as a feature extractor for support vector machines (SVMs), similar to the recently proposed JFA in total variability space. We can show the capability to reduce high-dimensional count vectors to low dimension while keeping system performance stable. With additional intersession compensation, we can improve 30% relative to the baseline system and reach an equal error rate of 8.8% on the NIST 2006 SRE dataset.\n",

Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of characterizing speaker information using just the mean vectors of the GMM in conjunction with support vector machine (SVM). This paper advocates the use of spectral correlation captured by covariance matrices, and investigates its effectiveness compared to and in complement with the mean vectors. We examine two approaches, i.e., homoscedastic and heteroscedastic modeling, in estimating the spectral correlation. We introduce two kernel metrics, i.e., Frobenius angle and log-Euclidean inner product, for measuring the similarity between speech utterances in terms of spectral correlation. Experiment conducted on the NIST 2006 speaker verification task shows that approximately 10% of improvement is achieved by using the spectral correlation in conjunction with the mean vectors.\n",

    "Existing automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems perform with high accuracy when the speech signal is collected close to the mouth of the speaker (< 1 ft). However, the performance of these systems reduces significantly when speech signals are collected at a distance from the speaker (2-6 ft). The objective of this paper is to address some issues in the processing of speech signals collected at a distance from the speaker, for text-dependent ASV system. An acoustic feature derived from short segments of speech signals is proposed for the ASV task. The key idea is to exploit the high signal-to-noise nature of short segments of speech in the vicinity of impulse-like excitations. We show that the proposed feature yields better performance of speaker verification than the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). In addition, regions of high signal-to-reverberation ratio, duration and pitch information are used to improve the performance of the ASV system for distant speech.\n",

In our method, the EM statistics are calculated only using the Gaussians selected by cluster UBM to improve the speed of estimating factor analysis model.

Then we show that SS method and the JFA-SVM system using GMM super-vector space as input have nearly the same form in scoring phase. We also show that the performance of SS method is better than the JFA-SVM system, which indicates that applying the KL kernel function directly to obtain a score in GMM super-vector space is as effective as the JFA-SVM trained using the same kernel. As an inspiration of this direct scoring method in which kernel function is only used to calculate score without SVM training procedure, we try to extend the relationship to speaker factor space and evaluate some results based on different kernels.\n",

    "Using GMM-supervectors as the input to SVM classifiers (namely, GMM-SVM) is one of the promising approaches to text-independent speaker verification. However, one unaddressed issue is the severe imbalance between the numbers of speaker-class utterances and impostor-class utterances available for training a speaker-dependent SVM. This paper proposes a resampling technique -- namely utterance partitioning with acoustic vector resampling (UP-AVR) -- to mitigate this problem. Specifically, the sequence order of acoustic vectors in an enrollment utterance is first randomized; then the randomized sequence is partitioned into a number of segments. Each segment is used to produce a GMM-supervector via MAP adaptation and mean-vector concatenation. A desirable number of speaker-class supervectors can be produced by repeating this process a number of times. Experimental evaluations suggest that UP-AVR can reduce the EER of GMM-SVM systems by about 10%.\n",

During segmentation, a phoneme sequence is first recognized using a phoneme recognizer and then text-dependent speaker recognition based on dynamic time warping (DTW) is performed on the same phoneme in two adjacent windows.

    "Being able to recognize people from their voice is a natural ability that we take for granted. Recent advances have shown significant improvement in automatic speaker recognition performance. Besides being able to process large amount of data in a fraction of time required by human, automatic systems are now able to deal with diverse channel effects. The goal of this paper is to examine how state-of-the-art automatic system performs in comparison with human listeners, and to investigate the strategy for human-assisted form of automatic speaker recognition, which is useful in forensic investigation. We set up an experimental protocol using data from the NIST SRE 2008 core set. A total of 36 listeners have participated in the listening experiments from three sites, namely Australia, Finland and Singapore. State-of-the-art automatic system achieved 20% error rate, whereas fusion of human listeners achieved 22%.\n",

    "This paper introduces a generalized formulation of linear prediction (LP), including both conventional and temporally weighted LP analysis methods as special cases. The temporally weighted methods have recently been successfully applied to noise robust spectrum analysis in speech and speaker recognition applications. In comparison to those earlier methods, the new generalized approach allows more versatility in weighting different parts of the data in the LP analysis. Two such weighted methods are evaluated and compared to the conventional spectrum modeling methods FFT and LP, as well as the temporally weighted methods WLP and SWLP, by substituting each of them in turn as the spectrum estimation method of the MFCC feature extraction stage of a GMM-UBM based speaker verification system. The new methods are shown to lead to performance improvement in several cases involving channel distortion and additive noise mismatch between the training and recognition conditions.\n",

    "Last year, we showed that the computation of a GMM-UBM-based speaker verification (SV) system may be sped up by 30 times by using a high-density discrete model (HDDM) on the NIST 2002 evaluation task. The speedup was obtained using a special case of the product-code vector quantization in which each dimension is scalar-quantized in the construction of the discrete model. However, the speedup resulted in a drop of an absolute 1.5% in equal-error rate (EER). In this paper, our previous work is generalized to the use of subvector quantization (SVQ) in the construction of HDDM. For the same NIST 2002 SV task, the use of SVQ leads to an overall speedup by a factor of 8-25 with no significant loss in EER performance.\n",

However the excitation signal produced by the glottis is expected to convey complementary relevant information about the speaker identity. This paper explores the use of two proposed glottal signatures, derived from the residual signal, for speaker identification. Experiments using these signatures are performed on both TIMIT and YOHO databases. Promising results are shown to outperform other approaches based on glottal features. Besides it is highlighted that the signatures can be used for text-independent speaker recognition and that only several seconds of voiced speech are sufficient for estimating them reliably.\n",

The principle behind the method is that certain features are better at recognising certain speakers. Thus, rather than using the same feature representation for all speakers, we use different features for different speakers. During training, we determine the optimal feature for each speaker from candidate features, by measuring information-theoretic criteria. During evaluation, verification is performed using the optimal feature of the claimed speaker. Experimental results with four candidate features show that the proposed system outperforms conventional systems that use a single feature or a combination of features.\n",

    "Universal background model based Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM-UBM) approach is a widely used method for speaker identification, where a GMM model is used to characterize a specific speakers voice. The estimation of model parameters is generally performed based on the maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) criteria. However, interspeaker information to discriminate between different speakers is not taken into account in ML and MAP parameter estimation. To overcome this limitation, we design a discriminative performance metric to capture interspeaker variabilities leading to improve the classification performance of the GMM-UBM system. A learning algorithm is presented to tune the Gaussian mixture weights by optimizing the detection performance of GMM classifiers. We design an objective function to directly relate the model parameters to the performance metric. The comparative study of the proposed method is done with the GMM-UBM system on the 2001 NIST SRE corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm considerably improves the GMM-UBM system on speaker identification.\n",

Except for the process being used to extract such keys, there is no need for acoustic modeling and processing in the approach proposed, as all the other elements in the system are based on the binary vectors. We show that this binary key is able to effectively model a speaker's voice and to distinguish it from other speakers. Its main properties are its small size compared to current speaker modeling techniques and its low computational cost when comparing different speakers as it is limited to obtaining a similarity metric between two binary vectors. Furthermore, the binary key vector extraction process does not need any threshold and offers the opportunity to set the decision steps in a well defined binary domain where scores and decisions are easy to interpret and implement.\n",

    "In speaker recognition (SRE), the commonly used feature vector is basic ceptral coefficients concatenating with their delta and double delta cepstal features. This configuration is borrowed from speech recognition and may be not optimal for SRE. In this paper, we propose a variant time-frequency cepstral (TFC) features, which is based on our previous work for language recognition. The feature vector is obtained by performing a temporal discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the cepstrum matrix and selecting the transformed elements in a specific area with large variances. Different shapes and parameters are tested and the optimal configuration is obtained. Experimental results on the 2008 NIST speaker recognition evaluation short2 telephone-short3 telephone test set show that the proposed variant TFC is more effective than the conventional feature vectors.\n",

    "Auditory experiments show insensitivity of human ears to phase information in perceiving phonetic content of speech signal. However, the discarded phase information may provide useful acoustic cue for identifying individual speaker, this is especially useful for speaker recognition systems operated with degraded magnitude in adverse conditions. This paper is therefore motivated to derive phase-related features for reliable speaker recognition performance. A pertinent representation for most dominant primary frequencies present in the speech signal is first built. It is then applied to frames of the speech signal to derive effective speaker-discriminative features. Through a set of specifically designed experiments on synthetic vowels, it is observed that the proposed features are capable of differentiating the inclusive formants, pitch harmonics from other components, and expressing the vocal particularities in various-shaped formants. By combining with standard cepstral parameters, these phase-related features have shown to evidently reduce the identification error rate and equal error rate in the context of Gaussian mixture model-based speaker recognition system.\n",

    "During last decade, researchers in speaker recognition have been working over the same acoustic space, regardless of whether the data lie on a linear space or not. Our proposal is to take into account the inner geometric structure of the speech in order to obtain a new space with a better representation of the speech data. A topological approach based on manifolds obtained thanks to Laplacian and Isomap algorithms is proposed. In this first work, the proposal is evaluated in terms of dimension reduction of the supervector space, known to have a high redundancy. The experiments are done in the NIST-SRE framework. It appears that the proposed approach allows to reduce by a factor four the dimension of the supervector space without losses in terms of EER.

    "It is well known that MFCC based speaker identification (SID) systems easily break down under mismatched training and test conditions. In this paper, we report on a study that considers four different single-channel speech enhancement front-ends for robust SID under such conditions. Speech files from the YOHO database are corrupted with four types of noise including babble, car, factory, and white Gaussian at five SNR levels (020 dB), and processed using four speech enhancement techniques representing distinct classes of algorithms: spectral subtraction, statistical model-based, subspace, and Wiener filtering. Both processed and unprocessed files are submitted to a SID system trained on clean data. In addition, a new set of acoustic feature parameters based on Hilbert envelope of gammatone filterbank outputs are proposed and evaluated for SID task. Experimental results indicate that: (i) depending on the noise type and SNR level, the enhancement front-ends may help or hurt SID performance, (ii) the proposed feature significantly achieves higher SID accuracy compared to MFCCs under mismatched conditions.\n",

For dictionary training we use an algorithm which can be described as non-negative matrix factorization with l0 sparseness constraints. In order to infer likely source spectrogram candidates, we approximate the intractable exact inference by maximizing the posterior over a plausible subset of solutions. We compare our system to the factorial-max vector quantization model, where the proposed method shows a superior performance in terms of signal-to-interference ratio.

    "In a practical speech enhancement system, it is required to enhance speech signals from the mixed signals, which were corrupted due to the nonstationary source signals and mixing conditions. The source voices may be from different moving speakers. The speakers may abruptly appear or disappear and may be permuted continuously. To deal with these scenarios with a varying number of sources, we present a new method for nonstationary speech separation. An online Gaussian process independent component analysis (OLGP-ICA) is developed to characterize the real-time temporal structure in time-varying mixing system and to capture the evolved statistics of independent sources from online observed signals. A variational Bayes algorithm is established to estimate the evolved parameters for dynamic source separation. In the experiments, the proposed OLGP-ICA is compared with other ICA methods and is illustrated to be effective in recovering speech and music signals in a nonstationary speaking environment.\n",

    "Musical noise often arises in the outputs of time-frequency binary mask based blind source separation approaches. Post-processing is desired to enhance the separation quality. An efficient musical noise reduction method by time-domain sparse filters is presented using convex optimization. The sparse filters are sought by L1 regularization and the split Bregman method. The proposed musical noise reduction method is evaluated by both synthetic and room recorded speech and music data, and found to outperform existing musical noise reduction methods in terms of the objective and subjective measures.\n",

    "Most existing binaural approaches to speech segregation rely on spatial filtering. In environments with minimal reverberation and when sources are well separated in space, spatial filtering can achieve excellent results. However, in everyday environments performance degrades substantially. To address these limitations, we incorporate monaural analysis within a binaural segregation system. We use monaural cues to perform both local and across frequency grouping of mixture components, allowing for a more robust application of spatial filtering. We propose a novel framework in which we combine monaural grouping evidence and binaural localization evidence in a linear model for the estimation of the ideal binary mask. Results indicate that with appropriately designed features that capture both monaural and binaural evidence, an extremely simple model achieves a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of up to 4 dB relative to using spatial filtering alone.\n",

    "To achieve high quality synthesised speech in HMM-based speech synthesis, the effective modelling of complex contexts is critical. Traditional approaches use context-dependent HMMs with decision tree based clustering to model the full contexts. However, weak contexts are difficult to capture using this approach. Context adaptive training provides a structured framework for this whereby standard HMMs represent normal contexts and linear transforms represent additional effect of weak-contexts. In contrast to speaker adaptive training, separate decision trees have to be built for the weak and normal context factors. This paper describes the general framework of context adaptive training and investigates three concrete forms: MLLR, CMLLR and CAT based systems. Experiments on a word-level emphasis synthesis task show that all context adaptive training approaches can outperform the standard full-context-dependent HMM approach. The MLLR based system achieved the best performance.\n",

    "The current state-of-art HMM-based speech synthesis can produce highly intelligible speech but still carries the intrinsic vocoding flavor due to its simple excitation model. In this paper, we propose a new HMM trajectory tiling approach to high quality TTS. Trajectory generated by the refined HMM is used to guide the search for the closest waveform segment tiles in rendering highly intelligible and natural sounding speech. Normalized distances between the HMM trajectory and those of waveform unit candidates are used for constructing a unit sausage. Normalized cross-correlation is used to finding the best unit sequence in the sausage. The sequence serves as the best segment tiles to track closely the HMM trajectory guide. Tested on the two British English databases, our approach can render natural sounding speech without sacrificing the high intelligibility achieved by HMM-based TTS. They are confirmed subjectively by the corresponding AB preference and intelligibility tests.\n",

However, the effect has never been investigated in formal objective and subjective tests. In this paper, the acceleration parameters in trajectory generation are studied in depth. We show that discarding acceleration parameters only introduces small additional distortion. But human subjects can easily perceive the quality degradation, because saw-tooth-like trajectories are commonly generated. Therefore, we choose the upper- and lower-bounded envelopes of the saw-tooth trajectories for further analysis. Experimental results show that both envelope trajectories have larger objective distortions. However, the speech synthesized using the envelope trajectories becomes perceptually transparent to the reference. This perceptual study facilitates efficient implementation of low-cost TTS systems, as well as low bit rate speech coding and reconstruction.\n",

    "This paper presents an improved method of training for the unvoiced filter that comprises an excitation model, within the framework of parametric speech synthesis based on hidden Markov models. The conventional approach calculates the unvoiced filter response from the differential signal of the residual and voiced excitation estimate. The differential signal, however, includes the error generated by the voiced excitation estimates. Contaminated by the error, the unvoiced filter tends to be overestimated, which causes the synthetic speech to be noisy. In order for unvoiced filter training to obtain targets that are free from the contamination, the improved approach first separates the non-periodic component of residual signal from the periodic component. The unvoiced filter is then trained from the non-periodic component signals. Experimental results show that unvoiced filter responses trained with the new approach are clearly noiseless, in contrast to the responses trained with the conventional approach.\n",

A universal warping function is constructed for improving MLLR-based speaker adaptation performance in TTS. The function is used to warp the frequency scale of a source speakers data toward that of the target speakers data and an HMM of frequency warped feature of the source speaker is trained. Finally, the MLLR-based speaker adaptation is applied to the trained HMM for synthesizing the target speakers speech. When tested on a database of 4,000 sentences (source speaker) and 100 sentences of a male and a female speaker (target speakers), the formant based frequency warping has been found very effective in reducing log spectral distortion over the system without formant frequency warping and this improvement is also confirmed subjectively in AB preference and ABX speaker similarity listening tests.\n",

This consists of amassing audio web contents, extracting usable speech from them, further transcribing the speech to surface text and performing phone-time alignment, and using the speech and transcripts to build HMMbased voices. A set of experiments is conducted to evaluate this approach. The results indicate that: large volumes of audio content are available on the internet, in which more than 33.3% of web radio data are unusable for building voices due to noise, music, and the speakers overlapping. Among the 14 voices built from limited radio monologues in Japanese, there are three fair (middle of the five-point scale) voices but two voices are bad (the lowest level). The influence of erroneous transcripts on voice quality is significant. In order to achieve fair voice quality with limited speech data, the phone and word accuracy of speech transcriptions must be higher than 80% and 50%, respectively.\n",

    "This paper describes conversational spontaneous speech synthesis based on hidden Markov model (HMM). To reduce the amount of data required for model training, we utilize average-voice-based speech synthesis framework, which has been shown to be effective for synthesizing speech with arbitrary speaker's voice using a small amount of training data. We examine several kinds of average voice model using reading-style speech and/or conversational speech. We also examine an appropriate utterance unit for conversational speech synthesis. Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage model adaptation method improves the quality of synthetic conversational speech.\n",

    "A variety of methods for audio-visual integration, which integrate audio and visual information at the level of either features, states, or classifier outputs, have been proposed for the purpose of robust speech recognition. However, these methods do not always fully utilize auditory information when the signal-to-noise ratio becomes low. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate speech signal in noise environments. The key idea behind this approach is to exploit clean speech candidates generated by using timing structures between mouth movements and sound signals. We first extract a pair of feature sequences of media signals and segment each sequence into temporal intervals. Then, we construct a cross-media timing-structure model of human speech by learning the temporal relations of overlapping intervals. Based on the learned model, we generate clean speech candidates from the observed mouth movements.\n",

Rhythm features are calculated using a new method based solely on the short-time energy function; formant features are derived using the standard formant tracker SNACK. Our findings indicate that 3 rhythm and 3 formant features have a high potential to detect intoxication within the speech data of a subject. We also tested the hypothesis that vowels are more centralized in the F1/F2 space for alcoholized speech, but found that, on the contrary, subjects tend to hyper-articulate when being tested for intoxication.\n",

The voice source parameters F0, EE, UP, OQ, RG, RA, RK and RD were obtained through inverse filtering and subsequent parameterisation using the LF-model. The results suggest that the focally accented syllables are marked not only by increased F0 but also by boosted EE, RG and UP. The non-focal realisations show reduced values for the above parameters along with a tendency towards higher OQ values, suggesting a more lax mode of phonation.\n",

A multivariate analysis based on Wilks' lambda test, of 169,042 occurrences of phonemes, can analyze spectral and prosodic changes of each phonetic class.

Perceptual tests were carried out comparing sentences that were either unprocessed or delexicalized, using a baseline or the proposed method. An intelligibility test resulted in a keyword recall rate of 92% for the unprocessed sentences, and near complete unintelligibility for both delexicalization methods. Affect recognition was at 65% for unprocessed sentences, and 46% and 49% for the baseline and the proposed method, respectively. Preference tests showed that the proposed method preserved drastically more speaker identity, and sounded more natural than the baseline.\n",

As speech-to-text usually presents significantly more computational effort, in this study we investigate the degree of speech-to-text accuracy needed for reliable detection of emotions from an automatically generated transcription of an utterance. We evaluate the use of hypotheses in both training and testing, and compare several classification approaches on the same task. Our results show that emotion recognition performance stays roughly constant as long as word accuracy doesn't fall below a reasonable value, making the use of speech-to-text viable for training of emotion classifiers based on linguistics.\n",

First, we explore the application of the PMVDR feature for emotion characterization. Originally for accent/dialect and language identification (LID), PMVDR features are less sensitive to noise. Also developed for LID, shifted delta cepstral (SDC) approach can also be used as a means of incorporating additional temporal information about the speech into the feature vectors. As already known, super-segmental characteristics, such as pitch and intensity, can provide beneficial information to emotion recognition and we believe the improvement can be acquired from improved features. We performed evaluation on the Berlin database of emotion speech. The proposed system, PMVDR-SDC, outperforms the baseline system absolutely by 10.1%, which proves the validity of the approach. Furthermore, we find both PMVDR and SDC offers much better robustness in noisy condition than others, which is critical for the real application.\n",

This is done by concatenating bimodal diphone units, that is, units that comprise both acoustic and visual information. The latter is acquired using a stereovision technique. The proposed method addresses the problems of asynchrony and incoherence inherent in classic approaches to audiovisual synthesis. Unit selection is based on classic target and join costs from acoustic-only synthesis, which are augmented with a visual join cost. Preliminary results indicate the benefits of the approach, since both the synthesized speech signal and the face animation are of good quality.

We create a dialog feature that reflects these differences, and investigate its effectiveness in detecting both types of anger. Tests show the proposed feature combination improves the F-measure of Cold and HotAnger by 24.4 points and 8.8 points against baseline technique that uses only prosody.\n",

    "Non-driving related cognitive load and variations of emotional state may impact the drivers capability to control a vehicle and introduce driving errors. Availability of reliable cognitive load and emotion detection in drivers would benefit the design of active safety systems and other intelligent in-vehicle interfaces. In this study, speech produced by 68 subjects while driving in urban areas is analyzed. A particular focus is on speech production differences in two secondary cognitive tasks, interactions with a co-driver and calls to automated spoken dialog systems (SDS), and two emotional states during the SDS interactions - neutral/negative. A number of speech parameters are found to vary across the cognitive /emotion classes. Suitability of selected spectral- and production-based features for automatic cognitive task/emotion classification is investigated. A fusion of GMM/SVM classifiers yields an accuracy of 89% in cognitive task and 76% in emotion classification.\n",

    "Head movements are linked not only to symbolic gestures, such as head-nodding to represent yes or head-shaking to represent no, but also to the production of suprasegmental features of speech, such as stress, prominence, and other aspects of prosody. Recent studies have shown that head movements play a more direct role in the perception of speech. In this paper, we propose a novel method for recognizing head gestures that accompany speech. The proposed method tracks head movements that accompany speech by localizing the mouth position with a microphone array system. We also propose a recognition method for the mouth-position trajectory, in which Higher- Order Local Cross Correlation is applied to the trajectory. The recognition accuracy of the proposed method was on an average 90.25% for nineteen kinds of head gesture recognition tasks conducted in an open test manner, which outperformed the Hidden Markov Model-based method.\n",

    "In this paper, we address the question how speech and tangible interfaces can be combined in order to provide effective multimodal interaction in vehicles, taking into account the special requirements induced by the circumstances of driving. Speech is used to set the interaction context and a turn-and-push dial is used to manipulate/adjust. An experimental study is presented that measures the distraction induced by manual, speech-only, and multimodal interaction (combination of speech and turn-and-push dial). Results show that while subjects where able to perform more tasks in the manual condition, their driving was significantly safer with using speech-only or multimodal dialog. Supplemental contributions of this paper are descriptions of how a multimodal dialog manager as well as a driving simulation software are connected to the CAN vehicle bus as well as how driver distraction caused by interacting with a system are measured using the standardized lane change task.\n",

Our technique uses several linguistic resources that recognizes emotions in the input text according to its emotional affinity and assigns appropriate prosodic parameters as well as pitch accents by XML-based tagging to generate a synthesized speech sample. Then the synthesized sample is re-synthesized through TD-PSOLA based pitch manipulation in accordance to emotional connotation. The system employed MARY TTS system to readout a folk tale. The preliminary perceptual test results are encouraging and human judges, by listening to the re-synthesized speech samples of AST, could perceive happy, sad, and fear emotions much better than compared to when they listened non-affective synthesized speech.\n",

Since all sources of acoustic mismatch may not be appropriately modeled by just linear transformation, in this work, the efficacy of our recently proposed explicit acoustic (pitch and speaking rate) normalization in combination with the existing normalization/adaptation techniques is explored for mismatched children's speech recognition. The study shows that explicit normalization of pitch and speaking rate of children's speech further improves the effectiveness of the adaptation methods. With explicit acoustic normalization significant relative improvements of 13% and 5% are obtained over that obtained with combined VTLN and CMLLR for children's speech recognition on adults' speech trained models for connected digit and continuous speech recognition tasks, respectively.\n",

    "Linear regression based speaker adaptation approaches can improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) accuracy significantly for a target speaker. However, when the available adaptation data is limited to a few seconds, the accuracy of the speaker adapted models is often worse compared with speaker independent models. In this paper, we propose an approach to select a set of reference speakers acoustically close to the target speaker whose data can be used to augment the adaptation data. To determine the acoustic similarity of two speakers, we propose a distance metric based on transforming sample points in the acoustic space with the regression matrices of the two speakers. We show the validity of this approach through a speaker identification task. ASR results on SCOTUS and AMI corpora with limited adaptation data of 10 to 15 seconds augmented by data from selected reference speakers show a significant improvement in Word Error Rate over speaker independent and speaker adapted models.\n",

    "This paper investigates the combination of discriminative adaptation techniques. The discriminative MAP adaptation (DMAP) and discriminative feature MLLR (DfMLLR) are examined. Since each of the methods is proposed for distinct amount of adaptation data it is useful to combine them in order to preserve the systems performance in situations with varying amount of adaptation data. Generally, DfMLLR and DMAP are executed subsequently (DMAP preceded by DfMLLR) demanding to approach the data twice. Since both methods address the data through the same statistics an one-pass-combination was proposed in order to decrease the time consumption. The one-pass-combination utilizes the advantage of DfMLLR method to transform directly the feature vectors. However, instead of feature vectors the statistics are transformed, what allows to use already computed statistics without the need to process the data once again. All approaches are compared also to their non-discriminative alternatives.\n",

    "In this paper, we revisit the linear transformation for VTLN on conventional MFCC proposed by Sanand et. al. in [Interspeech 2008], using the idea of band-limited interpolation. The filter-bank is modified to include half-filters at zero and nyquist frequencies, as the full symmetric spectrum is required for performing band-limited interpolation. In this paper, we show that the filter-bank with half-filters does not affect the recognition performance on clean speech (also shown in [Interspeech 2008]), but does affect the recognition performance on noisy speech. This motivated us to revisit the linear transformation for VTLN in [Interspeech 2008] and propose modifications to undo the affect of half-filters during the feature extraction. We show through recognition experiments that the proposed modifications to the linear transformation have comparable performance as the conventional VTLN approach, still enabling us to perform VTLN using a linear transformation on conventional MFCC.\n",

Although MLLR uses multiple transforms according to regression classes, only a single linear transform is applied to each state. The proposed method performs nonlinear speaker adaptation based on a new likelihood function combining HMMs for recognition with GMMs for spectral transform. Moreover, the context dependency of transforms can also be estimated in the integrated ML fashion. In phoneme recognition experiments, the proposed technique shows better performance than the conventional approaches.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a new system combination approach for an LVCSR system using speaker-class (SC) models and a speaker adaptation technique based on these SC models. The basic concept of the SC-based system is to select speakers who are acoustically similar to a target speaker to train acoustic models. One of the major problems regarding the use of the SC model is determining the selection range of the speakers. In other words, it is difficult to determine the number of speakers that should be selected. In order to solve this problem, several SC models, which are trained by a variety of number of speakers are prepared in advance. In the recognition step, acoustically similar models are selected from the above SC models, and the scores obtained from these models are merged using a word graph combination technique. The proposed method was evaluated using the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ), and showed significant improvement in a lecture speech recognition task.\n",

In this work, we apply 2DPCA to a set of MLLR transformation matrices of training speakers to obtain the bases for transformation space, since the matrices are 2-D in nature, and 2DPCA can decompose a set of matrices without vectorization. Here, we present two approaches using 2DPCA: One in eigenspace-based MLLR (ES-MLLR) framework and the other one in maximum a posteriori linear regression (MAPLR) framework.

We tested these two methods extensively on telephone speech corpus SpeechDat-East. The results obtained in these experiments suggest that incorporation of SAT into MLP ANN training process is beneficial and depending on the setup it leads to significant decrease of phoneme error rate (3 % - 8 % absolute, 12 % - 25 % relative).\n",

    "For robust distant-talking speech recognition, a novel HMM training approach using data pairs is proposed. The data pairs of clean and reverberant feature vectors, also called stereo data, are used for deriving the HMM parameters of a matched-condition reverberant HMM from a well-trained clean-speech HMM in two steps. In the first step, the alignment of the frames to the states is determined from the clean data and the clean-speech HMM. This state-frame alignment (SFA) is then used in the second step to estimate the Gaussian mixture densities for each state of the reverberant HMM by applying the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to the reverberant data. Thus, a more accurate temporal alignment is achieved than by standard matched condition training, and the discrimination capability of the HMMs is increased. Connected digit recognition experiments show that the proposed approach decreases the word error rate (WER) by up to 44% while substantially reducing the training complexity.\n",

    "This paper presents an improved wavelet-based dereverberation method for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Dereverberation is based on filtering reverberant wavelet coefficients with the Wiener gains to suppress the effect of the late reflections. Optimization of the wavelet parameters using acoustic model enables the system to estimate the clean speech and late reflections effectively. This results to a better estimate of the Wiener gains for dereverberation in the ASR application. Additional tuning of the parameters of the Wiener gain in relation with the acoustic model further improves the dereverberation process for ASR. In the experiment with real reverberant data, we have achieved a significant improvement in ASR accuracy.\n",

    "In this article the authors continue previous studies regarding the investigation of methods that aim to increase the recognition rate (RR) in reverberant environments of automatic speech recognition systems. Previously three robust front-end methods are tested, the harmonicity based feature analysis (HFA), the temporal power envelope feature analysis and their combination. This paper additionally introduces two well-known methods into the comparison. These are the dereverberation method using the inverse modulation transfer function and the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB). Recognition experiments are accomplished for command word recognition. The results of this first comparison of such methods prove experimentally some drawn assumptions, e. g. the IMTF method achieves robustness only in the far field, the DSB improves the RR slightly but is outperformed by the HFA due to its indirectivity at low frequencies.\n",

    "Automatic pronunciation assessment has several difficulties. Adequacy in controlling the vocal organs is often estimated from the spectral envelopes of input utterances but the envelope patterns are also affected by other factors such as speaker identity. Recently, a new method of speech representation was proposed where these non-linguistic variations are effectively removed through modeling only the contrastive aspects of speech features. This speech representation is called speech structure. However, the often excessively high dimensionality of the speech structure can degrade the performance of structure-based pronunciation assessment. To deal with this problem, we integrate multilayer regression analysis with the structure-based assessment. The results show higher correlation between human and machine scores and also show much higher robustness to speaker differences compared to widely used GOP-based analysis.\n",

When a text of spoken sentence was unknown, we obtained a correlation of 0.878 for 10 utterances. For English phonetic evaluation, we classified English phoneme pairs that are difficult for Japanese speakers to pronounce, using SVM, NN, and HMM classifiers. The correct classification ratios for native English and Japanese English phonemes were 94.6% and 92.3% for SVM, 96.5% and 87.4% for NN, 85.0% and 69.2% for HMM, respectively. We then investigated the relationship between the classification rate and a native English teacher's pronunciation score, and obtained a high correlation of 0.6 - 0.7.\n",

By traversing the corresponding paths and nodes associated with a test utterance a sequence of corrective comments can be generated to guide the learner for potential improvement. Therefore a detailed pronunciation indication or a comparison between two paths can be provided to learners which are usually unavailable in score-based CAPT systems.\n",

The second module, perception assistance module, is intended to help learners correctly perceive English stress patterns, which can automatically exaggerate the differences between stressed and unstressed syllables in a teachers voice. The third module, production assistance module, is developed to help learners to make aware of the rhythm of English language and provide learners feedback in order to improve their production of stress patterns.\n",

    "We present a pronunciation error detection method for second language learners of English (L2 learners). The method is a combination of confidence scoring at the phone level and landmark-based Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Landmark-based SVMs were implemented to focus the method on targeting specific phonemes in which L2 learners make frequent errors. The method was trained on the phonemes that are difficult for Korean learners and tested on intermediate Korean learners. In the data where non-phonemic errors occurred in a high proportion, the SVM method achieved a significantly higher F-score (0.67) than confidence scoring (0.60). However, the combination of the two methods without the appropriate training data did not lead to improvement. Even for intermediate learners, a high proportion of errors (40%) was related to these difficult phonemes. Therefore, a method that is specialized for these phonemes would be beneficial for both beginners and intermediate learners.\n",

    "In current text content especially web contents, there are many mixed language contents, i.e. Mandarin text mixed with English words. To make the synthesized speech of mixed language contents sound natural, we need to synthesize the mixed languages content with a single voice. However, this task is very challenging because we can hardly find a talent who can speak both languages well enough. The synthesized speech will sound unnatural if the HMM based TTS is directly built with the non-native speakers training corpus. In this paper, we propose to use speaker adaptation technology to leverage the native speakers data to generate more natural speech for the non-native speaker. Evaluation results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the speaker consistency and naturalness of synthesized speech for mixed language text.\n",

Specifically, we show that language mismatch introduces unwanted language-specific information when estimating multiple transforms, thus making these transforms detrimental to adaptation performance. Our analysis demonstrates speaker characteristics should be separated from language characteristics in order to improve cross-lingual adaptation performance.\n",

It has been reported that the method performs better for IRS filtered speech corrupted by white Gauss noise or pink noise since speech spectrum can be accurately estimated in low frequencies. However, the evaluation was performed by using only time-invariant speech analysis, in which order of basis expansion was 1. In this paper, the performance of time-varying speech analysis is evaluated using Keele pitch database with respect to degree of voiced stationarity of frame. The evaluation demonstrates that the time-varying ELS-based robust complex analysis performs best for strong stationary voiced frame although it does not perform better for non-stationary voiced frame.\n",

    "We present a study on robust pitch estimation by integrating spectral and temporal information. Spectrum harmonics are important representations of the speech fundamental frequency (F0). Harmonic-related spectral peaks of speech evolve much more slowly than the spectral peaks of noise. This motivates the proposition of temporally accumulated peak spectrum (TAPS), which is computed by cumulating spectrum peaks over consecutive analysis frames. In TAPS, harmonics-related peaks are concentrated around the F0 and its multiples, while the peaks caused by noise are irregularly distributed with relatively small amplitude. A pitch estimation method is derived based on TAPS. Peak locations on the autocorrelation of TAPS indicate the frequency separations between the harmonic peaks, which are used to estimate the F0. The proposed method is evaluated on speech signals corrupted by white noise, speech noise and babble noise. The results show that our method performs more robustly and reliably than conventional methods.\n",

In this paper, the amplitude and frequency modulation patterns are analyzed for the first three speech resonances in relation to the fundamental frequency (F0). The formant tracks are estimated, and the resonant signals are extracted and demodulated. The Amplitude Modulation Index (AMI) and Frequency Modulation Index (FMI) are computed, and examined in relation to the F0 value, as well as the relation between F0 and the first formant value (F1). Both AMI and FMI are significantly affected by pitch, with modulations being more frequently present in low F0 conditions. Evidence of non-linear interaction between the glottal source and the vocal tract is found in the dependence of the modulation patterns on the ratio of F1 over F0. AMI is amplified when pitch harmonics coincide with F1, while FMI shows complementary behavior.\n",

    "This paper proposes a pitch determination method utilizing the autocorrelation function in the spectral domain. The autocorrelation function is a popular measurement in estimating pitch in time domain. The performance of the method, however, is effected due to the position of dominant harmonics (usually the first formant) and the presence of spurious peaks introduced in noisy conditions. We applied a series of operations to obtain a noise-compensated and flattened version of the amplitude spectrum which takes a shape of harmonics train. Application of the autocorrelation function on this preconditioned spectrum produces a sequence where the true pitch peak can be readily located. Experiments on long speech signals spoken by a number of male and female speakers have been conducted. Experimental results demonstrate the merit of the proposed method when compared with other popular methods.\n",

    "It was recently shown that complex cepstrum can be effectively used for glottal flow estimation by separating the causal and anticausal components of speech. In order to guarantee a correct estimation, some constraints on the window have been derived. Among these, the window has to be synchronized on a Glottal Closure Instant. This paper proposes an extension of the complex cepstrum-based decomposition by incorporating a chirp analysis. The resulting method is shown to give a reliable estimation of the glottal flow wherever the window is located. This technique is then suited for its integration in usual speech processing systems, which generally operate in an asynchronous way. Besides its potential for automatic voice quality analysis is highlighted.\n",

In these scenarios, alternative strategies are required. This paper describes a method which, given the parameters of the glottal formant of the signal frame, can accurately parameterize the glottal shape source and vocal filter for a broad range of voice quality types and which is robust to the corruption of the phase spectrum.\n",

This algorithm is first tested on a database of sustained vowels spoken at different voice qualities, then on running speech. Results are evaluated in comparison to the value of the open quotient obtained by analysis of the synchronous ElectroGlottoGraphic (EGG) signal. Results of this test show that open quotient is estimated within the just noticeable difference from the EGG reference in more than 60% of the cases, and that 75% of the estimations give a value within 25% of the reference. The estimation results on asymmetry are also discussed and confirm previous studies.\n",

    "For speaker recognition studies, it is necessary to process the speech signal suitably to capture the speaker-specific information. There is complementary speaker-specific information in the excitation source and vocal tract system characteristics. Therefore it is necessary to separate these components, even approximately, from the speech signal. We propose linear prediction (LP) residual and LP coefficients to represent these two components. Analysis is performed in a pitch synchronous manner in order to focus on the significant portion of the speech signal in each glottal cycle, and also to reduce the artifacts of digital signal processing on the extracted features. Finally, the speaker-specific information is captured from the excitation and the vocal tract system components using autoassociative neural networks (AANN) models. We show that the pitch synchronous extraction of information from the residual and vocal tract system bring out the speaker-specific information much better than using the pitch asynchronous analysis as in the traditional block processing using an analysis window of fixed size.\n",

    "Acoustic characteristics of speech signals differ with gender due to physiological differences of the glottis and the vocal tract. Previous research [1] showed that adding the voice-source related measures H1*-H2* and H1*-A3* improved gender classification accuracy compared to using only the fundamental frequency (F0) and formant frequencies. Hi* refers to the i-th source spectral harmonic magnitude, and Ai* refers to the magnitude of the source spectrum at the i-th formant. In this paper, three other voice source related measures: CPP, HNR and H2*-H4* are used in gender classification of children's voices. CPP refers to the Cepstral Peak Prominence, HNR refers to the harmonic-to-noise ratio, and H2*-H4* refers to the difference between the 2nd and the 4th source spectral harmonic magnitudes. Results show that using these three features improves gender classification accuracy compared with [1]. Reference Y.-L. Shue and M.

Prominent Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) peaks in speech spectra are robust information source from which F0 can be inferred. A probabilistic framework is proposed to model the effect of additive noise on voiced speech spectra. It is observed that prominent SNR peaks located in the low frequency band are important to F0 estimation, and prominent SNR peaks in the middle and high frequency bands are also useful supplemental information to F0 estimation under noisy conditions, especially babble noise condition. Experiments show that the SAFE algorithm has the lowest Gross Pitch Errors (GPE) compared to prevailing F0 trackers: Get_F0, Praat, TEMPO, and YIN, in white and babble noise conditions at low SNRs.\n",

These dynamics are the important cues for perceiving individuality of a singer, and can be a useful measure for various applications, such as singing skill evaluation and singing voice synthesis. While most previous studies have modeled the dynamics using a second-order linear system, the automatic and accurate estimation of model parameters has yet to be accomplished. In this paper, we first develop a complete stochastic representation of the second-order system with Gaussian processes from parametric discretization, and propose a complete, efficient scheme for parameter estimation using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method can decompose an F0 contour into a musical component and a dynamics component. Finally, we discuss estimating singing styles from the model parameters for each singer.\n",

The multi-channel signal enhancement deploys an 8 channel Geometric Source Separation (GSS). During pitch extraction we apply a Gammatone filter bank and then calculate a histogram of zero crossing distances based on the band-pass signals. While calculating the histogram spurious side peaks at harmonics and sub-harmonics of the true fundamental frequency are inhibited. The following grid based Bayesian tracker comprises a Bayesian filtering in a forward step and Bayesian smoothing in a backward step. We evaluate the system in a realistic human-robot interaction scenario with several male and female speakers. Hereby, we also include the comparison to two well established pitch extraction frameworks, i.e. get_f0 included in the WaveSurfer Toolkit and Praat.\n",

In a complementary way, this paper investigates the variation of the glottal flow in Lombard speech. For this, the glottal flow is estimated by a closed-phase analysis and parametrized by a set of time and spectral features. Through a study on a database containing 25 speakers uttering in clean and noisy environments (with 4 noise types at 2 levels), it is highlighted that the glottal source is significantly modified due to the increased vocal effort. Such changes are of interest in several applications of speech processing, such as speech or speaker recognition, or speech synthesis.\n",

    "Spoken term detection is important for retrieval of multimedia and spoken content over the Internet. Because it is difficult to have acoustic/language models well matched to the huge quantities of spoken documents produced under various conditions, unsupervised approaches using frame-based dynamic time warping (DTW) has been proposed to compare the spoken query with spoken documents frame by frame. In this paper, we propose a new approach of unsupervised spoken term detection using segment-based DTW. Speech signals are segmented into sequences of acoustically similar segments using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and a DTW procedure is formulated for segment sequences along with the clustering tree structures. In this way, the number of highly redundant parameters can be reduced, and the relatively unstable feature vectors can be replaced by more stable segments which describe the sequence of vocal track stages during the uttering process. Preliminary experiments indicate a high reduction of computation time as compared to frame-based DTW, although the slightly degraded detection performance implies much room for further improvements.\n",

    "Discriminative confidence estimation along with confidence normalisation have been shown to construct robust decision maker modules in spoken term detection (STD) systems. Discriminative confidence estimation, making use of termdependent features, has been shown to improve the widely used lattice-based confidence estimation in STD. In this work, we augment the set of these term-dependent features and show a significant improvement in the STD performance both in terms of ATWV and DET curves in experiments conducted on a Spanish geographical corpus. This work also proposes a multiple lineal regression analysis to carry out the feature selection. Next, the most informative features derived from it are used within the discriminative confidence on the STD system.\n",

    "In this paper, a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)-based document clustering approach is proposed for the cluster-based language model for spoken document retrieval. The retrieval language model comprises three different unigram models: a whole corpus collect-based unigram, document-based unigram, and a document clustering-based unigram. They are combined with double linear interpolations. Document clustering is realized via the NMF method; each document is clustered into an axis in which it has maximum projection in the latent semantic space derived by the NMF. The initialization of NMF, which is an important factor influencing NMF performance, is based on the clustered results of the K-means clustering approach. Using these approaches, retrieval experiments are conducted on a test collection from the corpus of spontaneous Japanese (CSJ). It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional vector space model (VSM), the maximum improvement of the retrieval perform-ance (mean average precision: MAP) exceeds 36%, outstripping the conventional query likelihood model, which has improvement of 7.4%. It is also found that the proposed method surpasses the K-means clustering method when adequate initialization of NMF is used.\n",

This makes it possible to evaluate the impact of approximations that compensation schemes make, such as the form of the mismatch function.\n",

In this paper we show how uncertainty propagation can also be used to yield minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates of the clean speech directly in the recognition domain. We develop a MMSE estimator for the Mel-cepstral features by propagation of the Wiener filter posterior distribution and show how it outperforms conventional MMSE methods in the STFT domain on the AURORA4 large vocabulary test environment.\n",

One of the important issues associated with CASA is the accurate estimation of mask information for target speech separation within multiple microphone noisy speech. For such a task, the timefrequency mask information is compensated through the signaltonoise ratio resulted from a beamformer to adjust the noise quantity included in noisy speech. We evaluate the performance of an automatic speech recognition system employing a CASAbased frontend with the proposed mask compensation method. Then, we compare its performance with those employing a CASAbased frontend without mask compensation and the beamformingbased frontend. As a result, the CASAbased frontend with the proposed method achieves relative WER reductions of 26.52% and 8.57%, compared that the beamformer and a CASAbased frontend alone, respectively.\n",

While in previous algorithms, the fixed threshold ITD had been obtained empirically from training data in a specific environment, in real environments the characteristics that affect the optimal value of this threshold are unknown and possibly time varying. If these configurations are different from the environment under which ITD threshold had been pre-computed, the performance of the source separation system is degraded. In this paper, we present an algorithm which chooses a threshold ITD that minimizes the cross-correlation of the target and interfering signals, after a compressive nonlinearity. We demonstrate that the algorithm described in this paper provides speech recognition accuracy that is much more robust to changes in environment than would be obtained using a fixed threshold ITD.\n",

We analyze different ways to design such channel detectors: based on cepstral features or on the Factor Analysis channel variability term.

In this work, the approach based on cross-decoder co-occurrences of phone n-grams is further developed and evaluated. Systems were built by means of open software and experiments were carried out on the NIST LRE2007 database. A system based on co-occurrences of phone n-grams (up to 4-grams) outperformed the baseline phonotactic system, yielding around 8% relative improvement in terms of EER. The best fused system attained 1,90% EER, which supports the use of cross-decoder dependencies for improved language modeling.\n",

This knowledge is introduced into a Multi-Layer Perceptron phone recognizer by training mono-phone models for two varieties as contrasting phone-like classes. Significant improvements in terms of identification rate were achieved compared to conventional single and fused phonotactic and acoustic systems. The VID system is used to select data to automatically train variety-specific acoustic models for broadcast news transcription.

Using these vectors, we design a kernel function that computes the similarities of phones between pairs of utterances. We employ this kernel to train SVM classifiers that estimate posterior probabilities, used during recognition. Testing our approach on four Arabic dialects from 30s cuts, we compare our performance to five approaches: PRLM; GMM-UBM; our own improved version of GMM-UBM which employs fMLLR adaptation; our recent discriminative phonotactic approach; and a state-of-the-art system: SDC-based GMM-UBM discriminatively trained.

    "How to detect mispronounced words/phonemes and to provide appropriate, to-the-point diagnosis feedback correctly is a challenging task in Computer Aided Pronunciation Training. In this study, we propose a discriminative training algorithm to jointly optimize error detection performance (i.e. false rejection and false acceptance) and diagnosis feedback accuracy (i.e., pinpointing accurately the mispronounced words/phones and providing proper feedback). An optimization procedure, similar to the Minimum Word Error (MWE) discriminative training, is developed to refine the ML-trained HMMs. The errors to be minimized are obtained by comparing hand transcribed speech training utterances by phoneticians with canonical pronunciations of the words and common mispronunciations which are embedded in a confusion network (compiled by handcrafted rules or data-driven rules derived from labeled training data.) A database of 8,575 English utterances (split into 5,988 for training and 2,587 for testing) spoken by 100 Cantonese English learners is used to measure the performance of the new algorithm. Several conclusion can be drawn from the experiments: (1) data-driven rules are more effective than hand-crafted ones in capturing (modeling) mispronunciations; (2) compared with the ML training baseline, discriminative training can reduce the false rejection and diagnostic errors while degrading the false acceptance performance slightly due to a smaller number of false-acceptance samples in the training set.\n",

    "Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training System (CAPT) has become an important learning aid in second language (L2) learning. Our approach to CAPT is based on the use of phonological rules to capture language transfer effects that may cause mispronunciations. This paper presents an approach for automatic derivation of phonological rules from L2 speech. The rules are used to generate an extended recognition network (ERN) that captures the canonical pronunciations of words, as well as the possible mispronunciations. The ERN is used with automatic speech recognition for mispronunciation detection. . Experimentation with an L2 speech corpus that contains recordings from 100 speakers aims to compare the automatically derived rules with manually authored rules. Comparable performance is achieved in mispronunciation detection (i.e. telling which phone is wrong). The automatically derived rules also offer improved performance in diagnostic accuracy (i.e. identify how the phone is wrong).\n",

    "We have developed an automated method that predicts the word accuracy of a speech recognition system for non-native speech, in the context of speaking proficiency scoring. A model was trained using features based on speech recognizer scores, function word distributions, prosody, background noise, and speaking fluency. Since the method was implemented for non-native speech, fluency features, which have been used for non-native speakers' proficiency scoring, were implemented along with several feature groups used from past research. The fluency features showed promising performance by themselves, and improved the overall performance in tandem with other more traditional features. A model using stepwise regression achieved a correlation with word accuracy rates of 0.76, compared to a baseline of 0.63 using only confidence scores. A binary classifier for placing utterances in high-or low-word accuracy bins achieved an accuracy of 84%, compared to a majority class baseline of 64%.\n",

    "In this paper, we proposed a new approach based on dominant set [1] for tone error detection in strong accented Mandarin. First, the final boundary generated from forced alignment is regulated by the F0 contour in order to locate the final domain more accurately. After that, proper normalization techniques are explored for the tone features. Finally, clustering and classification methods based on dominant set are utilized for the tone error detection. The proposed approach is tested in comparison with the traditional k-means based method, experimental results show that it achieves more satisfying performance with an average Cross-Correlation 0.84 between human and machine, reaches to that between humans, which have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The main advantage of this approach lies in not only the error pronunciation of tone can be well identified, but also the F0 pattern of the tone error can be informatively provided as the feedback.\n",

Initially the electroglottogram (EGG) and its derivative signals are compared across different emotions. The mean, standard deviation and contour of instantaneous pitch, and strength of excitation parameters are derived by processing the derivative of the EGG and also speech using zero-frequency filtering (ZFF) approach. The comparative study of these features across different emotions reveals that the effect of emotions on the excitation source is distinct and significant. The comparative study of the parameters from the derivative of EGG and speech waveform indicate that both cases have the same trend and range, inferring any of them may be used. Use of the computed parameters are found to be effective in the prosodic modification task\n",

These were based on both local and global speech duration, energy, MFCC and pitch features. This paper aims to study the relative importance of these four categories of acoustic features in this emotion estimation context. Three measures are considered: the number of features from each category when all features are used in selection, the mean absolute error (MAE) when each category is used separately, and the MAE when a category is excluded from feature selection. We find that the relative importance is in the order of MFCC > Energy = Pitch > Duration. Additionally, estimator fusion almost always improves performance, and locally weighted fusion always outperforms average fusion regardless of the number of features used.\n",

The clean train/noisy test scenario is investigated to simulate conditions with unknown noisy sources. The sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) method is adopted to demonstrate the redundancy of RS features and further dimensionality reduction is conducted.

Statistical testings demonstrate that some of these measures capture useful information; they show higher values in interactions with couple having high positive attitude compared to high negative attitude. Further, by using quantized entrainment measures employed with statistical symbol sequence matching in a maximum likelihood framework, we obtained 76% accuracy in predicting positive affect vs. negative affect.\n",

    "The proper representation of emotion is critical in classification systems. In previous research, we demonstrated that emotion profile (EP) based representations are effective for this task. In EP-based representations, emotions are expressed in terms of underlying affective components from the subset of anger, happiness, neutrality, and sadness. The current study explores cluster profiles (CP), an alternate profile representation in which the components are no longer semantic labels, but clusters inherent in the feature space. This unsupervised clustering of the feature space permits the application of a system-level semi-supervised learning paradigm. The results demonstrate that CPs are similarly discriminative to EPs (EP classification accuracy: 68.37% vs. 69.25% for the CP-based classification). This suggests that exhaustive labeling of a representative training corpus may not be necessary for emotion classification tasks.\n",

However, many technical applications demand for very quick system responses, e.g. to prepare different feedback alternatives before the end of a speaker turn in a dialog system. We therefore investigate this gating paradigm employing two spoken language resources in a cross- and combined manner with a focus on valence: we determine how quick a reliable estimate is obtainable and whether matching by models trained on the same length of speech prevails. In addition we analyze how individual feature groups by type and derived functionals respond and find considerably different behavior. The language resources have been chosen to cover for manually segmented and automatically segmented speech at the same time. In the result one second of speech is sufficient on the datasets considered.\n",

In this paper, as opposed to the conventional N-best rescoring, we propose a direct modification approach on the 1-best hypothesis of recognition results using selective tone distinction. Experiments were performed on noisy speech at SNRs of 20dB and 9dB. Over the baseline without using tone information, our proposal achieved error reductions of 24%~27% for both SNRs, which is significantly better than the error reduction of 10-best rescoring. Moreover, the relatively constant error reduction seen in wide-ranging SNR demonstrates the robustness of our proposal.\n",

Refining the acoustic model with this strategy, word accuracy is improved, especially words that contain a low-frequency phoneme.\n",

    "This paper is focused on the use of acoustic information from an existing source language (Cantonese) to implement speaker adaptation for a new target language (English). Speaker-independent (SI) model mapping between Cantonese and English is investigated at different levels of acoustic units. Phones, states, and Gaussian mixture components are used as the mapping units respectively. With the model mapping, cross-lingual speaker adaptation can be performed. The performance of the proposed cross-lingual speaker adaptation system is determined by two factors: model mapping effectiveness and speaker adaptation effectiveness. Experimental results show that the model mapping effectiveness increased with the refinement of mapping units, and the speaker adaptation effectiveness depends on the model mapping effectiveness. Mapping between Gaussian mixture components is proved effective for various speech recognition tasks. A relative error reduction of 10.12% on English words is achieved by using a small amount of (4 minutes) Cantonese adaptation data, compared with the SI English recognizer.\n",

In order to benefit from existing Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) resources, a cross-lingual acoustic modeling approach is proposed that is based on supervised model adaptation. MSA acoustic models were adapted using MLLR and MAP with an in-house collected ECA corpus. Phoneme-based and grapheme-based acoustic modeling were investigated. To make phoneme-based adaptation feasible, we have normalized the phoneme sets of MSA and ECA. Since dialectal Arabic is mainly spoken, graphemic form usually does not match actual spelling as in MSA, a graphemic MSA acoustic model was used to force align and to choose the correct ECA spelling from a set of automatically generated spelling variants lexicon. Results show that the adapted MSA acoustic models outperformed acoustic models trained with only ECA data.\n",

    "While hidden Markov modeling is still the dominant paradigm for speech recognition, in recent years there has been renewed interest in alternative, template-like approaches to acoustic modeling. Such methods sidestep usual HMM limitations as well as inherent issues with parametric statistical distributions, though typically at the expense of large amounts of memory and computing power. This paper introduces a new framework, dubbed latent perceptual mapping, which naturally leverages a reduced dimensionality description of the observations. This allows for a viable parsimonious template-like solution where models are closely aligned with perceived acoustic events. Context-independent phoneme classification experiments conducted on the TIMIT database suggest that latent perceptual mapping achieves results comparable to conventional acoustic modeling but at potentially significant savings in online costs.\n",

    "In context of Large-Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition, systems can reach a high level of performance when dealing with prepared speech, while their performance drops on spontaneous speech. This decrease is due to the fact that these two kind of speech are marked by strong acoustic and linguistic differences. Previous research works had been done to detect and repair some peculiarities of spontaneous speech, as disfluencies, and to create specific models to improve recognition accuracy: a large amount of data is needed to see improvements and is expensive to collect. In this paper, we present a solution to create specialized acoustic and language models, by automatically extracting a data subset from the initial training corpus containing spontaneous speech, and adapting initial acoustic and linguistic models on it. As we assume these models can be complementary, we propose to combine general and adapted ASR system outputs. Experimental results show statistically significant gain, for a negligible cost (no additional training data and no human intervention).\n",

    "This paper proposes a state-based labeling for acoustic patterns of speech and a method for using this labelling in noise-robust automatic speech recognition. Acoustic time-frequency segments of speech, exemplars, are obtained from a training database and associated with time-varying state labels using the transcriptions. In the recognition phase, noisy speech is modeled by a sparse linear combination of noise and speech exemplars. The likelihoods of states are obtained by linear combination of the exemplar weights, which can then be used to estimate the most likely state transition path. The proposed method was tested in the connected digit recognition task with noisy speech material from the Aurora-2 database where it is shown to produce better results than the existing histogram-based labeling method.\n",

    "We develop a similarity measure to detect repeatedly occurring Out-of-Vocabulary words (OOV), since these carry important information. Sub-word sequences in the recognition output from a hybrid word/sub-word recognizer are taken as detected OOVs and are aligned to each other with the help of an alignment error model. This model is able to deal with partial OOV detections and tries to reveal more complex word relations such as compound words. We apply the model to a selection of conversational phone calls to retrieve other examples of the same OOV, and to obtain a higher-level description of it such as being a derivation of a known word.\n",

In the original DBNs, only frame-level information was used for training DBN weights while it has been known for long that sequential or full-sequence information can be helpful in improving speech recognition accuracy. In this paper we investigate approaches to optimizing the DBN weights, state-to-state transition parameters, and language model scores using the sequential discriminative training criterion. We describe and analyze the proposed training algorithm and strategy, and discuss practical issues and how they affect the final results. We show that the DBNs learned using the sequence-based training criterion outperforms that with frame-based criterion on three-layer DBNs and explain why the gain vanishes on six-layer DBNs, when evaluated on TIMIT.\n",

    "Information retrieval methods are frequently used for indexing and retrieving spoken documents, and more recently have been proposed for voice-search amongst a pre-defined set of business entries. In this paper, we show that these methods can be used in an even more fundamental way, as the core component in a continuous speech recognizer. Speech is initially processed and represented as a sequence of discrete symbols, specifically phoneme or multi-phone units. Recognition then operates on this sequence. The recognizer is segment-based, and the acoustic score for labeling a segment with a word is based on the TF-IDF similarity between the subword units detected in the segment, and those typically seen in association with the word. We present promising results on both a voice search task and the Wall Street Journal task. The development of this method brings us one step closer to being able to do speech recognition based on the detection of sub-word audio attributes.\n",

    "This paper describes a new toolkit - SCARF - for doing speech recognition with segmental conditional random fields. It is designed to allow for the integration of numerous, possibly redundant segment level acoustic features, along with a complete language model, in a coherent speech recognition framework. SCARF performs a segmental analysis, where each segment corresponds to a word, thus allowing for the incorporation of acoustic features defined at the phoneme, multi-phone, syllable and word level. SCARF is designed to make it especially convenient to use acoustic detection events as input, such as the detection of energy bursts, phonemes, or other events. Language modeling is done by associating each state in the SCRF with a state in an underlying n-gram language model, and SCARF supports the joint and discriminative training of language model and acoustic model parameters. SCARF is available for download from http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/scarf/\n",

The test-set errors and clustering of the estimated target values indicate that for this corpus, formant targets depend on the speaking style. As an application, the vowel classification accuracy was tested with both style-indepently and dependently based on observed formant values and estimated target values. Token-based style-independent classification shows greater accuracy for conversational speech (82.19%) than observed-value classification (73.97%).\n",

The study of voice source features, which describe the action of the vocal folds, is important for a deeper understanding of emotion encoding in speech. In this study we investigate inter and intra-speaker differences in voicing activities as a function of emotion using electroglottography (EGG) and inverse filtering technique. Results demonstrate that while voice quality features are good indicators of affective state, voice source descriptors vary in affective information across speakers. Glottal ratio measurements taken directly from the EGG signal are more reliable than measurements from the inverse-filtered glottal airflow signal, but the spectral harmonic amplitude differences of EGG are less useful than from inverse filtering.\n",

We investigated the changes in voice quality with respect to linguistic prosodic signaling of focus in simple three word utterances. We used inverse filtering based methods for calculating and parametrizing the glottal flow in several different vowels and focus conditions. The results supported our hypothesis -- formed by an earlier study of voice quality changes in running speech -- that more prominent syllables are produced with a less tense voice quality and less prominent ones with a more tense phonation.

In this paper, a simplified vocal tract/tooth geometric model is used to carry out a numerical study on the flow-induced noise generated by a tooth-shaped obstacle placed in a channel.

A maximum likelihood trajectory smoothing using the estimated dynamics of the articulators is also applied on the regression estimates. The average root mean square error in estimating articulatory positions, given the acoustics, is 1.56 mm for the non-parametric regression and 1.52 mm for the local linear regression. The local linear regression is found to perform significantly better than regression using Gaussian Mixture Models using the same acoustic and articulatory features.\n",

We introduce two types of the functions, and present the method to estimate the parameters of each function using the observed phoneme spectrum. In the synthesis stage, speech signals are generated from the parameters of the Multiple function. The advantage of this method is that it only requires a few speech synthesis parameters.

    "The physical nature of weak body-conducted vocal-tract resonance signals called non-audible murmur (NAM) were investigated using numerical simulation and acoustic analysis of the NAM signals. Computational fluid dynamics simulation reveals that a weak vortex flow occurs in the supraglottal region when uttering NAM; a source of NAM is a turbulent noise source produced due to a vortex flow. Furthermore, computational acoustics simulation reveals that NAM signals attenuate 50 dB at 1 kHz consisting of 30-dB full-range attenuation due to air-to-body transmission loss and 10-dB/octave spectral decay due to a sound propagation loss within the body, which roughly equals to the measurement results.\n",

    "The relative transfer function generalized sidelobe canceler (RTF-GSC) is a popular method for implementing multichannel speech enhancement. However, an accurate estimation of channel transfer function ratios pose a challenge, especially in noisy environments. In this work, we demonstrate that even a very low order RTF estimate can give superior performance in terms of noise reduction without incurring excessive speech distortion. We show that noise reduction is dependent on the correlation between the input noise and the noise reference generated by the Blocking Matrix (BM), and that a low order RTF estimate preserves this correlation better than a high order one. The performance for both high order and low order RTF estimates are compared using output SNR, Noise Reduction and a perceptual measure for speech quality.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a reinforced Blocking Matrix of TF-GSC by incorporating a cross channel projection for speech enhancement. Transfer function GSC (TF-GSC) proposed by Gannot was aimed at improving speech quality but the desired speech signal becomes somewhat distorted since the reference signal resulting from blocking matrix significantly contains the desired signal. The proposed reinforcement on the Blocking Matrix is a scheme to remove the highly correlated components between the inter-channel reference signals using orthogonal projection, thereby completely eliminating the desired signal. Representative experiments show that the proposed scheme is effective and its strength is demonstrated in terms of improved averaged signal noise ratio(SNR) and Log Spectral Distance(LSD).\n",

The proposed method exploits this specificity in the case of the hands-free speech interface. This method is in particular able to deal with non-stationary noise. The method can be divided in three steps. First, the steering vector pointing at the target user is estimated from the covariance of the observed signals. Then the noise estimate is obtained by cancelling the user's contribution. During this step the speech pauses are also estimated. Finally a post-filter is used to suppress this estimated noise from the observed signals. The post-filter strength is controlled by using the estimated noise during the speech pauses as reference. A 20k-words dictation task in presence of non-stationary diffuse background noise at different SNR levels illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

We extend the classical iterative wiener filter (IWF) to the multi-channel dereverberation case. The late reverberations are estimated using Long-term Multi-step Linear Prediction (LTMLP). This estimate is used in CCIMWF framework through a doubly iterative formulation. A clean speech VQ codebook is effective for inducing intra-frame constraints and improve the convergence of IWF, thus, a joint-CCIMWF algorithm is proposed for the multi-channel case. The signal to reverberation ratio (SRR) and log spectral distortion (LSD) measures improve through the double-iterations, showing that the algorithm suppresses the effect of late reverberations and improves speech quality and intelligibility. The algorithm also has fair convergence properties through the iterations.\n",

    "A throat microphone (TM) produces speech which is perceptually poorer than that produced by a close speaking microphone (CSM) speech. Many attempts at improving the quality of TM speech have been made by mapping the features corresponding to the vocal tract system. These techniques are limited by the methods used to generate the excitation signal. In this paper a method to map the source (excitation) using multilayer feed-forward neural networks is proposed for voiced segments. This method anchors the analysis windows at the regions around the instants of glottal closure, so that the non-linear characteristics in these region of TM and CSM microphone is emphasized in the mapping process. The features obtained from these regions for both TM and CSM speech are used to train a MLFFNN to capture the non-linear relation between them. An improved technique for mapping the system features is also proposed. Speech synthesized using the proposed techniques was evaluated through subjective tests and was found to be significantly better than TM speech.\n",

An analytic equation detection system, Eureqa, which can infer nonlinear relations directly from observed data, was used to identify the enhancement models. Speech recognition experiments with the enhanced throat microphone speech keywords indicate that the analytic enhancement models performed well in terms of recognition accuracy. Unvoiced consonants, however, could not be enhanced well enough, mostly because they were not effectively recorded by the throat microphone.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose the modulation-domain Kalman filter (MDKF) for speech enhancement. In contrast to previous modulation domain-enhancement methods based on bandpass filtering, the MDKF is an adaptive and linear MMSE estimator that uses models of the temporal changes of the magnitude spectrum for both speech and noise. Also, because the Kalman filter is a joint magnitude and phase spectrum estimator, under non-stationarity assumptions, it is highly suited for modulation-domain processing, as modulation phase tends to contain more speech information than acoustic phase. Experimental results from the NOIZEUS corpus show the ideal MDKF (with clean speech parameters) to outperform all the acoustic and time-domain enhancement methods that were evaluated, including the conventional time-domain Kalman filter with clean speech parameters. A practical MDKF that uses the MMSE-STSA method to enhance noisy speech in the acoustic domain prior to LPC analysis was also evaluated and showed promising results.\n",

In the present study, we discuss the concept of virtual targets and its application for articulatory speech synthesis. In particular, we examined how the location of virtual targets affects the acoustics and intelligibility of synthetic plosiv-vowel syllables. It turned out that virtual targets that lie about 10 mm beyond the consonantal closure location allow a more precise reproduction of natural speech signals than virtual targets at a distance of about 1 mm. However, we found no effect on the intellegibility of the consonants.\n",

With this method, the speech mechanism of the robot is much slower than is required for human speech, because the robot requires momentary movement of motors. To resolve this problem, we have developed a control method that mimics human articulatory trajectory data. The human trajectory data for continuous speech was obtained by using an electromagnetic articulography (EMA) system. The EMA data was converted to the robot control parameters by applying inverse kinematics as well as geometric transformation. Experimental results show that the robot can produce continuous speech with human-like speed and smooth movement.\n",

    "Arai has developed several physical models of the human vocal tract for education and has reported that they are intuitive and helpful for students of acoustics and speech science. We first reviewed dynamic models, including the sliding three-tube (S3T) model and the flexible-tongue model. We then developed a head-shaped model with a sliding tongue, which has the advantages of both the S3T and flexible-tongue models. We also developed a computer-controlled version of the Umeda & Teranishi model, as the original model was hard to manipulate precisely by hand. These models are useful when teaching the dynamic aspects of speech.\n",

    "A method for the analysis of prosodic-level temporal structure is introduced. The method is based on measured phase angles of an oscillator as that oscillator is made to synchronize with reference points in a signal. Reference points are the predicted peaks of acoustic change as determined by the output of a bank of tuned resonators. A framework for articulatory re-synthesis is then described. Jaw movements of a robotic vocal tract are made to replicate the mean phase portrait of an utterance with reference to a production oscillator. These jaw movements are modeled to inform the dynamics of within-syllable phonemic articulations.\n",

Recently, a novel class-based language model, Model M, was introduced and was shown to outperform regular n-gram models on moderate amounts of Wall Street Journal data. This model was motivated by the observation that shrinking the sum of the parameter magnitudes in an exponential language model leads to better performance on unseen data. In this paper we directly integrate the shrinkage-based language model into two different state-of-the-art machine translation engines as well as a large-scale dynamic speech recognition decoder. Experiments on official GALE and NIST development and evaluation sets show considerable and consistent improvement in both machine translation quality and speech recognition word error rate.\n",

An associated probability normalisation scheme is explicitly derived. Second, a novel NNLM adaptation method using a cascaded network is proposed. Consistent WER reductions were obtained on a state-of-the-art Arabic LVCSR task over conventional NNLMs. Further performance gains were also observed after NNLM adaptation.\n",

Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM.

The phonetic confusions prevalent in the recognizer are modeled using a confusion matrix that takes into account information from the pronunciation model (word-based phone confusion log likelihoods) and information from the acoustic model (distances between the phonetic acoustic models). This confusion matrix, within the WFST framework, is used to generate confusable word graphs that serve as inputs to the averaged perceptron algorithm to train the parameters of the discriminative language model. Experiments on a large vocabulary speech recognition task show significant word error rate reductions when compared to a baseline using a trigram model trained with the maximum likelihood criterion.\n",

A phoneme lattice is created using acoustic model scores, and Bayesian techniques are used to robustly learn a language model from this noisy input. A novel sampling technique is devised that allows for the integrated learning of word boundaries and an n-gram language model with no prior linguistic knowledge. The proposed techniques were used to learn a language model directly from continuous, potentially large-vocabulary speech. This language model was able to significantly reduce the ASR phoneme error rate over a separate set of test data, and the proposed lattice processing and lexical acquisition techniques were found to be important factors in this improvement.\n",

This is achieved via the use of long and overlapped frames as well as using a tapered window with a large side lobe attenuation for linear prediction analysis. We show that the Dolph-Chebychev window with a -200 dB side lobe attenuation tends to enhance the dynamic range of the formant structure of speech corrupted with white noise, reduce prediction error variance bias, as well as provide for some spectral smoothing, while the long overlapped frames provide for reliable autocorrelation estimates and temporal smoothing. Speech enhancement experiments on the NOIZEUS corpus show that the proposed method outperformed conventional iterative and non-iterative Kalman filters as well as other enhancement methods such as MMSE-STSA and PSC.\n",

    "Various speech enhancement techniques rely on the knowledge of the clean signal and noise statistics. In practice, however, these statistics are not explicitly available, and the overall enhancement accuracy critically depends on the estimation quality of the unknown statistics. The estimation of noise (and speech) statistics is particularly challenging under non-stationary noise conditions. In this respect, subspace-based approaches have been shown to provide a good tracking vs. final misadjustment tradeoff. Subspace-based techniques hinge critically on both rank-limited and spherical assumptions of the speech and the noise DFT matrices, respectively. The speech rank-limited assumption was previously experimentally tested and validated. In this paper, we will investigate the structure of nuisance sources. We will discuss the validity of the spherical assumption for a variety of nuisance sources (environmental noise, reverberation), and preprocessing (overlapping segmentation).\n",

The estimation of these statistics is particularly a critical issue and a challenging problem under non-stationary noise conditions. With this respect, subspace based approaches have shown to allow for reduced estimation delay and perform a good tracking vs. final misadjustment tradeoff. One key attribute for noise floor tracking is the estimation bias: an overestimation leads to over-suppression and to more speech distortion; while an underestimation leads to a high level of residual noise. The present paper investigates the bias of the subspace-based scheme, and particularly the robustness of the bias compensation factor to the desired speaker characteristics and the input SNR.\n",

By taking advantage of the similarity of the modulus maxima vectors between narrowband and wideband wavelet-analyzed signals a neural network mapping structure can be established to perform bandwidth expansion given only the narrowband version of speech. Since the proposed algorithm works on the time-domain waveforms it offers a flexibility of variable-length frame selection that facilitates low delay and potentially data-dependent speech segment processing to further improve the speech quality. Evaluations based on both objective and subjective measures show that the proposed bandwidth expansion approach results in high-quality synthesized wideband speech with little perceivable distortion from the original wideband speech signals.\n",

    "The perceived quality of a synthetic visual speech signal greatly depends on the smoothness of the presented visual articulators. This paper explains how concatenative visual speech synthesis systems can apply active appearance models to achieve a smooth and natural visual output speech. By modeling the visual speech contained in the system's speech database, a diversification between the synthesis of the shape and the texture of the talking head is feasible. This allows the system to accurately balance between the articulation strength of the visual articulators and the signal smoothness of the visual mode in order to optimize the synthesis. To improve the synthesis quality, an automatic database normalization strategy has been designed that removes variations from the database which are not related to speech production. As was verified by a perception experiment, this normalization strategy significantly improves the perceived signal quality.\n",

    "A necessary step in the generation of expressive speech synthesis is the automatic detection and classification of emotions most likely to be present in textual input. We have recently advocated [1] a new emotion analysis strategy leveraging two separate semantic levels: one that encapsulates the foundations of the domain considered, and one that specifically accounts for the overall affective fabric of the language. This paper expands this premise into a more general framework, dubbed latent affective mapping, to expose the emergent relationship between these two levels. Such connection in turn advantageously informs the emotion classification process. The benefits gained though a richer description of the underlying affective space are illustrated via an empirical comparison of two different mapping instantiations (latent affective folding and latent affective embedding) with more conventional techniques based on expert knowledge of emotional keywords and keysets.\n",

    "We are interested in the problem of extracting meaning structures from spoken utterances in human communication. In SLU systems, parsing of meaning structures is carried over the word hypotheses generated by the ASR. This approach suffers from high word error rates and ad-hoc conceptual representations. In contrast, in this paper we aim at discovering meaning components from direct measurements of acoustic and non-verbal linguistic features. The meaning structures are taken from the frame semantics model proposed in FrameNet. We give a quantitative analysis of meaning structures in terms of speech features across human--human dialogs from the manually annotated LUNA corpus. We show that the acoustic correlations between pitch, formant trajectories, intensity and harmonicity and meaning features are statistically significant over the whole corpus as well as relevant in classifying the target words evoked by a semantic frame.\n",

A French linguistic processing chain based on linguistic preprocessing, morpho-syntactical labeling, and deep syntactical parsing is used in order to extract syntactical features from an input text. These features are used to define more or less high-level syntactical feature sets. Such feature sets are compared on the basis of a HMM-based prosodic structure model.

A set of standard samples related to the top-cream students are initially picked up as templates, a cascade QBH structure is then taken from two metrics: the MOMEL stylization followed by DTW distance; the Fujisaki model followed by EMD distance. Sentence GOR is obtained by the fused confidence between target and each template, which is then weighted by a PRI factor in the passage level. Experiment results indicate that performance increases with the count of template, and Fujisaki-EMD metric outperforms MOMEL-DTW one in terms of correlation. Their combination can be treated as template based GOR score, compensated with our previous feature based GOR score, the approach can achieve 0.432 in correlation and 17.90% in EER in our corpus.\n",

This paper presents a method that considers spontaneous speech as a specific language, which could be identified by using language-recognition methods, such as shifted delta cepstrum parameters, dimensionality reduction by linear discriminant analysis and factor-analysis based filtering process. Experiments are conducted on the French EPAC corpus. On a 3 spontaneity-level task, this approach obtains a relative gain of about 22% of identification rates, in comparison to the classical MFCC/GMM technique. Then, we combine these techniques to others previously proposed for spontaneous speech detection. Finally, the proposed system obtains a recognition rate of 65% on high spontaneous speech segments.\n",

Recent studies have questioned the adaptation of phonological representations and kinematics of phonetic variables such as loudness, speech rate or fundamental frequency. Results are often contradictory and the effectiveness of phonetic convergence during conversation is still an open issue. This paper describes an original experimental paradigm  a game played in primary schools known as verbal dominoes - that enables us to collect several hundreds of syllables uttered by both speakers in different conditions: alone, in ambient speech or in full interaction. Speech recognition techniques are then applied to globally characterize phonetic convergence if any. We hypothesize here that convergence of phonetic representations such as vocalic dispersions is not immediate especially when considering common words of the target language.\n",

Subsequently, extensive tests are carried out on a selection of French emotional language resources well suited for a first impression on general applicability. A detailed analysis is presented to test the various modifications suggested one-by-one. Our conclusion is that the modification in the forward step result in a considerable improvement in speed (~80%) while no considerable and systematic loss in quality is experienced. The modifications in the backward step seem to have only significance when a higher number of features is achieved. The final clarification of this issue remains the task of future work. As a result we may suggest a quick feature selection algorithm, which is practically more suitable for the state of the art, larger corpora and wider feature-banks. Our quick SFFS is general: it can also be used in any other field of application.\n",

    "Methods for automated vocal emotion recognition often use acoustic feature vectors that are computed for each frame in an utterance, and global statistics based on these acoustic feature vectors. However, at least two considerations argue for usage of phoneme class specific features for emotion recognition. First, there are well-known effects of phoneme class on some of these features. Second, it is plausible that emotion influences the speech signal in ways that differ between phoneme classes. A new method based on the concept of phoneme class specific features is proposed in which different features are selected for regions associated with different phoneme classes and then optimally combined, using machine learning algorithms. A small but significant improvement was found when this method was compared with an otherwise identical method in which features were used uniformly over different phoneme classes.\n",

Experiments are conducted using the initial phase of a new multi view Audio-Visual database designed for research and development of pose-invariant speech and speaker recognition. We show that verification performance can be improved by substituting higher order horizontal DCT components for vertical, particularly in the case of a train/test pose angle mismatch. We further show that the best performance can be achieved by combining this alternative feature selection with multi view training, reporting a relative 45% Equal Error Rate reduction over a common energy based selection.\n",

Our hypothesis is that humans use different modulation methods in which articulatory movements and prosodic modulations are differently weighted across different emotions. This hypothesis was examined by joint analysis of the two domains, using two statistical representations: (1) the sample distribution comparison using two-sigma ellipses of the articulatory speed statistics and prosodic feature (pitch or intensity) statistics, (2) the comparison of correlation coefficients. In the articulatory-prosodic spaces, we find (1) distinctive weighting patterns for angry and happy emotional speech and (2) distinctive correlation patterns depending on articulators and target emotions. These findings support the hypothesis that humans use different modulation methods of emphasizing articulatory motions and/or prosodic activities depending on emotion.\n",

Since the spectro-temporal approach can be applied to a noise-reduced spectrum, we wanted to explore whether spectro-temporal features could improve the performance of AFE for ASR.

The results of perceptual experiments, however, suggested that phase spectral information based on long-term analysis includes certain linguistic information. In this paper, we propose the use of phase features based on long-term analysis for speech recognition. We use two types of parameters: the delta phase parameter as a group delay and analytic group delay features. Isolated word and continuous digit recognition experiments were performed, resulting in a greater than 90% word or digit accuracy for each of the experiments. The experimental results confirmed that a long-term phase spectrum includes sufficient information for recognizing speech. Furthermore, combining likelihoods of MFCC and long-term group delay cepstrum outperformed the baseline MFCC relatively 20% for clean speech.\n",

The presented methods transform the posteriors to 1,D or 2,D space. For such a high reduction ratio the usually applied methods fail to keep the discriminative information. Contrary, the presented methods were specifically designed to retain most of the discriminative information. In our experiments, we used several different combinations of feature extraction methods nowadays commonly used, i.e. the PLP features (augmented with delta and acceleration coefficients) and two kinds of MLP-ANN features: the bottleneck (BN) and posterior estimates (PE). The experiments were designed with special attention to the assessment of possible improvements of the performance when the PLP features are combined either with the BN features or with the PE features whose dimensionality was reduced using the proposed feature transforms. The performance of the designed transforms was tested on two different speech corpora: a telephone speech SpeechDat-East corpus and multi-modal Czech Audio-Visual corpus.\n",

On one hand, a five-layer neural network used in bottle neck feature extraction allows to obtain arbitrary feature size without dimensionality reduction by transform, independently of the training targets. On the other hand, a hierarchical processing technique is effective and robust over several conditions. Even though the hierarchical and bottle neck processing performs equally well, the combination of both topologies improves the system by 5% relative. Furthermore, the MFCC baseline system is improved by up to 20% relative. This behaviour could be confirmed on two different tasks. In addition, we analyse the influence of multi-resolution RASTA filtering and long-term spectral features as input for the neural network feature extraction.\n",

    "In this paper, we investigate the use of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals collected from articulatory muscles on the face and neck for performing automatic speech recognition. We present a systematic information-theoretic analysis for feature selection and optimal sensor subset selection. Our results indicate that Mel-cepstral frequency features are best suited for sEMG-based discrimination. Further, the sensor subset ranking obtained through the mutual information experiments are consistent with the results obtained from hidden Markov model based recognition. The framework presented here can be used for determining the best feature and sensor subset for a given speaker a priori, instead of determining them a posteriori from recognition experiments. We achieve a mean recognition accuracy of 80.6% with the best 5 sensor subset chosen by the MI analysis in comparison with 79.6% obtained from using all the sensors.\n",

    "In an attempt to improve models of human perception, the recognition of phonemes in nonsense utterances was predicted with automatic speech recognition (ASR) in order to analyze its applicability for modeling human speech recognition (HSR) in noise. In the first experiments, several feature types are used as input for an ASR system; the resulting phoneme scores are compared to listening experiments using the same speech data. With conventional training, the highest correlation between predicted and measured recognition was observed for perceptual linear prediction features (r = 0.84). Secondly, a new training paradigm for ASR is proposed with the aim of improving the prediction of phoneme intelligibility. For this perceptual training, the original utterance labels are modified based on the confusions measured in HSR tests. The modified ASR training improved the overall prediction, with the best models (r = 0.89) exceeding those obtained with conventional training (r = 0.80).\n",

This approach uses a NN to predict the HMM state posterior probabilities. The average posterior probability vectors computed over each phone segment are used as input features to a SVM back-end to generate the final verification scores. In this paper, a novel Hidden Logistic Feature (HLF) for SVM back-end is proposed, where the sigmoid activations from the hidden layer that contain rich information of the NN is used instead of the output layer and the generation of HLFs can be interpreted as a Hidden Logistic Linear Regression process. Experiments on the TIMIT database show that the proposed HLF gives the lowest Equal Error Rate of 3.63.\n",

    "Speaker-normalization and -adaptation methods are essential components of state-of-the-art speech recognition systems nowadays. Recently, so-called emph{invariant integration features} were presented which are motivated by the theory of invariants. While it was shown that the integration features outperform MFCCs when used with a basic monophone recognition system, it was left open, if their benefits still can be observed when a more sophisticated recognition system with speaker-normalization and/or speaker-adaptation components is used. This work investigates the combination of the integration features with standard speaker-normalization and -adaptation methods. We show that the integration features benefit from adaptation methods and significantly outperform MFCCs in matching, as well as in mismatching training-test conditions.\n",

We examine appropriate dimensionality reduction techniques for features extracted using different wavelet families and compare our results with the conventional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) used in speech recognition. Our results indicate that a simple model fusion between cepstral and wavelet domain features can achieve superior recognition performance. Fusing the MFCC and wavelet based SVM models using principal component analysis for feature reduction yields the best performance, with a mean accuracy of 95.13% over a set of nine speakers on a 65 word closed vocabulary task.\n",

    "In this paper, we investigate the recognition of cochlear implant-like spectrally reduced speech (SRS) using conventional speech features (MFCCs and PLP coefficients) and HMM-based ASR. The SRS was synthesized from subband temporal envelopes extracted from original clean speech for testing, whereas the acoustic models were trained on a different set of original clean speech signals of the same speech database. It was shown that changing the bandwidth of the subband temporal envelopes had no significant effect on the ASR word accuracy. In addition, increasing the number of frequency subbands of the SRS from 4 to 16 improved significantly the system performance. Furthermore, the ASR word accuracy attained with the original clean speech, by using both MFCC-based and PLP-based speech features, can be achieved by using the 16-, 24-, or 32-subband SRS. The experiments were carried out by using the TI-digits speech database and the HTK speech recognition toolkit.\n",

Target speech was localized at 45 degrees diagonal relative to the listener, while the noise was localized at various azimuths and distances from the listener. The SNR was set to 0, -6, -12 [dB]. We found little difference in intelligibility by headphone types, suggesting that cross-talk in bone-conduction headphones have negligible effect on intelligibility.\n",

    "Time reversal is often used in experimental studies on language perception and understanding, but little is known on its precise impact on speech sounds. Strikingly, some studies consider reversed speech chunks as speech stimuli lacking lexical information while others use them as non speech control conditions. The phonetic perception of reversed speech has not been thoroughly studied so far, and only impressionistic evaluation has been proposed. To fill this gap, we give here the results of a phonetic transcription task of time-reversed French pseudo-words by 4 expert phoneticians. Results show that for most phonemes (except unvoiced stops), several phonetic features are preserved by time reversal, leading to rather accurate transcriptions of reversed words. Other phenomena are also investigated, such as the emergence of epenthetic segments, and discussed with insight from the neurocognitive bases of the perception of time-varying sounds.\n",

In controls, we obtained an important informational masking in the monaural configuration mostly attributable to linguistic interferences. This was not observed with binaural noise, suggesting that this interference was suppressed by spatial separation. Dyslexic listeners showed a monaural deficit in Babble, but no deficit of the binaural processing, suggesting compensation based on the use of spatial cues.\n",

Results indicate that duration-based fluency measures yield as much or more information about proficiency as do structural complexity measures.

Equal amounts of cross-lingual and matched-language trials were presented. The experiments showed that listeners are able to complete this task well, they can discriminate between talkers significantly better than chance. However, listeners are significantly less accurate on cross-lingual talker trials than on matched-language pairs. No significant differences were found on this task between German and Finnish. Bias (B'') and Sensitivity (A') values are presented to analyse the listeners' behaviour in more detail. The results are promising for the evaluation of EMIME, a project covering speech-to-speech translation with speaker adaptation.\n",

    "The Japanese form of word play called dajare was investigated in the light of the concurrent multiple word activation mechanism proposed for spoken-word recognition. Analyses of a dajare database revealed distinct types of punning strategies, each of which can be seen as reflecting the activation mechanism. In the present study spontaneous conversations, compiled from a live Tokyo radio talk show, provided the dajare evidence. These results in spontaneous Japanese again confirm the activation predictions, suggesting that dajare is not a low form of wit: instead, it is clever exploitation of the the natural availability of multiple words in spoken-word recognition.\n",

    "This work addresses the classification in topics of utterances in Japanese, received by a speech-oriented guidance system operating in a real environment. For this, we compare the performance of Support Vector Machine and PrefixSpan Boosting, against a conventional Maximum Entropy classification method. We are interested in evaluating their strength against automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors and the sparseness of the features present in spontaneous speech. To deal with the shortness of the utterances, we also proposed to use characters as features instead of words, which is possible with the Japanese language due to the presence of kanji; ideograms from Chinese characters that represent not only sound but meaning. Experimental results show a classification performance improvement from 92.2% to 94.4%, with Support Vector Machine using character unigrams and bigrams as features, in comparison to the conventional method.\n",

We present two approaches to answer extraction in question answering for speech corpora that apply machine learning to improve the coverage and precision of the extraction. The first one is a reranker that uses only lexical information, the second one uses dependency parsing to score similarity between syntactic structures. Our experimental results show that the proposed learning models improve our previous results using only hand-made ranking rules with small syntactic information. We evaluate the system on manual transcripts of speech from EPPS English corpus and a set of questions transcribed from spontaneous oral questions.

    "Vocabulary restrictions in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems mean that out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are lost in the output. However, OOV words tend to be information rich terms (often named entities) and their omission from the transcript negatively affects both usability and downstream NLP technologies, such as machine translation or knowledge distillation. We propose a novel approach to OOV recovery that uses a spoken term detection (STD) framework. Given an identified OOV region in the LVCSR output, we recover the uttered OOVs by utilizing contextual information and the vast and constantly updated vocabulary on the Web. Discovered words are integrated into the system output, recovering up to 40% of the OOV terms and resulting in a reduction in system error.\n",

We experienced difficulties in the process of browsing for desired content when only these transcripts are given, especially since they are erroneous due to the ASR. Hence, we propose a lightweight and fast algorithm to retrieve keywords and tag-clouds from ASR transcripts to support content browsing. In contrast to similar algorithms, it calculates keywords ad-hoc and query-dependent while searching on a corresponding index. The proposed algorithm takes into account the relation between keywords and the search query, text weighting and linguistic constraints. For visualization we chose a scalable tag-cloud.

Automatic speech recognition technology has already been developed to enable essentially unlimited vocabulary in a mobile setting. Understanding the words that are spoken is the next challenge. In this paper, we describe efforts to develop a dataset and classifier to recognize named entities in speech. Using sets of both real and simulated data, in conjunction with a very large set of real named entities, we created a challenging corpus of training and test data. We developed a multi-stage framework to parse these utterances and simultaneously tag names and locations. Our combined system achieved an f-measure of 0.87 on extracted proper nouns, with a 95% accuracy on distinguishing names from locations.\n",

    "We propose a maximum lexical cohesion (MLC) approach to news story segmentation. Unlike sentence-dependent lexical methods, our approach is able to detect story boundaries at finer word/subword granularity, and thus is more suitable for speech recognition transcripts which have no sentence delimiters. The proposed segmentation goodness measure takes account of both lexical cohesion and a prior preference of story length. We measure the lexical cohesion of a segment by the KL-divergence from its word distribution to an associated piecewise uniform distribution. Taking account of the uneven contributions of different words to a story, the cohesion measure is further refined by two word weighting schemes, i.e. the inverse document frequency (IDF) and a new weighting method called difference from expectation (DFE). We then propose a dynamic programming solution to exactly maximize the segmentation goodness and efficiently locate story boundaries in polynomial time. Experimental results show that our MLC approach outperforms several state-of-the-art lexical methods.\n",

    "This paper proposes a phoneme lattice based TextTiling approach towards multilingual story segmentation. The phoneme is the smallest segmental unit in a language and the number of phonemes in a language is usually far smaller than the number of words. Furthermore, many phonemes are shared by different languages. These properties make phonemes particularly appropriate for representing multilingual speech. As phoneme recognition is far from perfect, phoneme lattices, which carry much richer statistics than the 1-best hypotheses, are adopted in this paper as the input to the TextTiling approach. The term frequencies used in traditional TextTiling are replaced by the expected counts of phoneme n-gram units calculated from phoneme lattices. Experiments on TDT2 English and Mandarin corpora show that the phoneme lattice based TextTiling outperforms the phoneme 1-best based TextTiling and word based TextTiling in broadcast news story segmentation.\n",

    "The objective intelligibility assessment of nonlinearly enhanced speech is a widely experienced problem. Nonlinear processors operate primarily on the low-level and transient components of speech. As these sections contain important acoustic cues as well as context-constitutive information, they dominate speech intelligibility. For that reason, short-time intelligibility measures at low-level and transient components are weighted with their contribution to the overall intelligibility. In this report, spectral features are calculated from auditory sub-bands and are utilized to label these sections of high information content. A genetic optimization is performed to adapt the spectral feature measures to psychoacoustical data. No improvement is found over existing methods of objective speech intelligibility assessment, using short-time intelligibility calculation and level-dependent weighting. Therewith, the reported results contribute to pinpoint practicable solutions to the problem.\n",

In order to gain more insight into the dimensional composition for arbitrary transmission conditions, an auditory method is described in this paper which allows for assessing these dimensions efficiently. The results can be used to model the total impairment, a measure of the reduction of integral quality which is compliant with the E-model, a parametric tool for speech quality prediction.

    "This paper analyzes the relationship between transmission delay, conversational interactivity and perceived quality of bi-directional speech. Our work is grounded on the results of subjective speech quality tests conducted in our lab and recent studies in this field. The test experiments do not only quantify the impact of network delay on speech quality as perceived by untrained subjects. They also assess the mutual influences between conversational interactivity (CI) and delay using three different conversation scenarios. Our results show a clear positive correlation between the level of conversational interactivity and interlocutors' delay sensitivity. Another key finding is that even in contexts of high interactivity, one-way delay values up to 400 ms did not have any significant impact on untrained participants' perception of overall speech quality. Furthermore, we examine the surface structure of participants' conversations across a wide range of delay conditions (up to 1600 ms). Our analysis demonstrates how additional metrics such as unintended interruption rate (UIR) can be successfully used to determine the surface structure and delay sensitivity of a conversation.\n",

    "This paper describes our initial experiments with a hybrid voice recognition architecture for mobile voice user interfaces. Our system consists of a large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer on the network side, and a compact embedded recognizer on the handset. The two components are seamlessly integrated to provide a uniform user experience at all times. The hybrid system is able to handle unconstrained voice input from the user at any time, while it also features significantly improved response times and availability of service when compared to a network-only configuration. We have tested the hybrid architecture in an experimental setup with real user data in six different languages. Our results show that depending on the availability of prior usage information from the users, 28-55% of voice queries can be handled locally, with virtually instantaneous recognition, at the cost of less than 5% relative increase in the overall word error-rate of the system.\n",

Three proposals for representation of dialogue data are described, and their effectiveness assessed at detecting topic boundaries on a large section of the Augmented Multi-Party Interaction (AMI) corpus. These proposals consist in representing a speech event though combinations of features such as the lengths of vocalisations, pauses and speech overlaps in the immediate temporal context of the event. Results show that timing of vocalisations alone, within a 7 vocalisation window (3 on each side of the vocalisation under consideration), can be an effective predictor of topic boundaries, outperforming topic segmentation methods based on lexical features. Pause and overlap information on their own also yield comparably good segmentation accuracy, suggesting that simple methods could complement or even serve as alternatives to methods which require more demanding speech processing for meeting browsing.\n",

The outcome is no impact or a small decrease in performance compared to using a fully supervised tagger, with even potential gains in case of domain mismatch for the supervised tagger. Tasks that trust the tags completely (like ASR post-processing) are more affected by a reduction of the starting dictionnary, but still yield positive outcome.\n",

The reduced dependency between both parsing and selection models opens interesting perspectives for future models combination. The approach is validated on a French broadcast news corpus creation task dedicated to dependency parsing. It outperforms the baseline uncertainty entropy-based selective sampling on this task.

The prosodic words and the corresponding mis-recognized word fragments are obtained from a speech database to construct a mis-recognized word fragment table for the extracted prosodic words. For each word fragment in a recognized word sequence, the potential prosodic words which are likely to be misrecognized as input word fragments are retrieved from the table for prosodic word candidate expansion. The prosodic word-based contextual information, considering substitution and concatenation scores, is then employed into a probabilistic model to find the best word fragment sequence as the corrected output.

The latter allows nonlinear analysis of complex dynamics and, particularly, characterizes the intermittent signature. We study the validity of the MMF for the speech signal and show that singularity exponents convey indeed valuable information about its local dynamics. We define an accumulative measure on the exponents which reveals phoneme boundaries as the breaking points of a piecewise linear-like curve. We then develop a simple automatic phonetic segmentation algorithm using piecewise linear curve fitting. We present experiments on the full TIMIT database. The results show that our algorithm yields considerably better accuracy than recently published ones.\n",

This should provide valuable information that helps to show the extent to which a phoneme may affect surrounding phonemes visually.

These respectively characterize the identity of the next event and the time at which the next event will occur. Probabilistic models of high-level constraints are developed, and then integrated into our event detection framework. We test this approach on audio tracks extracted from two different tennis games.

Perception experiment results suggest that rises reflect difficulty integrating new information rather than signaling a lack of credibility. This leads to a general analysis of rising intonation as signaling that the current question under discussion is unresolved. However, the interaction with cue word semantics restricts how much their interpretation can vary with prosody.\n",

The approximated contours were determined manually. In this study, a framework is developed for automatic approximation of F0 contours. Based on the knowledge learned from perceptual studies, the approximation process is carried out in three steps: contour smoothing, locating turning points and determining F0 values at turning points. Perceptual evaluation was performed on re-synthesized speech of hundreds of Cantonese polysyllabic words. The results show that the proposed framework produces good approximations for the observed F0 contours.

    "Although typically studied as an auditory phenomenon, prosody can also be conveyed by the visual speech signal, through increased movements of articulators during speech production, or through eyebrow and rigid head movements. This paper aimed to quantify such visual correlates of prosody. Specifically, the study was concerned with measuring the visual correlates of prosodic focus and prosodic phrasing. In the experiment, four participants speech and face movements were recorded while they completed a dialog exchange task with an interlocutor. Acoustic analysis showed that prosodic contrasts differed on duration, pitch and intensity parameters, which is consistent with previous findings in the literature. The visual data was processed using guided principal component analysis. The results showed that compared to the broad focused statement condition, speakers produced greater movement on both articulatory and non-articulatory parameters for prosodically focused and intonated words.\n",

    "Exploiting the computational power of multi-core processors for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) requires changes in the recognizer architecture. In this paper, we consider how to parallelize the search component of a lexical-tree based speech recognizer. We introduce a hybrid-parallel method for dynamically dividing the lexical-tree copies among the cores at each frame. Each core is responsible for graph traversal in the lexical-tree copies allocated to it. This approach is compared to a previously-introduced static method that divides the lexical tree itself, so that each core is responsible for a different subtree of each of the lexical-tree copies. The new method outperforms the previous one when applied to the RWTH TC-STAR EPPS English LVCSR system running on four cores of an Intel Core-i7 processor with varying pruning-beam width settings.\n",

    "The emergence of highly parallel computing platforms is enabling new trade-offs in algorithm design for automatic speech recognition. It naturally motivates the following investigation: Do the most computationally efficient sequential algorithms lead to the most computationally efficient parallel algorithms? In this paper we explore two contending recognition network representations for speech inference engines: the linear lexical model (LLM) and the weighted finite state transducer (WFST). We demonstrate that while an inference engine using the simpler LLM representation evaluates 22x more transitions per second than the advanced WFST representation, the simple structure of the LLM representation allows 4.7-6.4x faster evaluation and 53-65x faster operand-gathering for each state transition. We use the 5k Wall Street Journal Corpus to experiment on the NVIDIA GTX480 (Fermi) and the NVIDIA GTX285 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and illustrate that the performance of a speech inference engine based on the LLM representation is competitive with the WFST representation on highly parallel implementation platforms.\n",

Experiments run on 2 large tasks show the method to be very effective, typicality reducing memory and disk requirements to less than 35%.

   "abstract": [
    "Korean is an agglutinative and highly inflective language with a severe phonological phenomenon and coarticulation effects, making the development of a large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition system (LVCSR) difficult. Choosing a Korean orthographic word-phrase (eojeol) as a basic recognition unit leads to high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates, whereas choosing an orthographic syllable (eumjeol) unit results in high acoustic confusability. To overcome these difficulties, we propose to construct the speech recognition task as a serial architecture composed of two independent parts. The first part is to perform a standard hidden Markov model (HMM)-based recognition of phonemic syllable units of the actual pronunciation (surface forms). In this way, one phonemic syllable corresponds to one possible pronunciation only. Thus, the lexicon dictionary and OOV rates can be kept small, while avoiding high acoustic confusability. Here, the Korean orthography of written transcription are not yet considered. In the second part, the system then transforms the phonemic syllable surface forms into the desirable orthography of a recognition unit, e.g., eumjeol or eojeol. To solve this task, a noisy-channel model is utilized, wherein the sequence of phonemic syllables is considered as noisy string, and the goal is to recover the clean string of Korean orthography. The entire process requires no linguistic knowledge, only annotated texts. The experiments were conducted on a Korean dictation database, where the best system could achieve 91.21% eumjeol accuracy and 71.30% eojeol accuracy.\n",

    "To distinguish Japanese single and geminate stops in two- and three-mora words spoken at varied speaking rates, the ratio of stop closure to the word in native speakers production was previously found to be a reliable measure. It was not clear, however, whether the stop closure relates more stably (1) to the entire word of any length than just (2) to the moras preceding and following the contrasting stops. This study examined this question with three- and four-mora nonsense words in Japanese. Results indicate that the stop closure duration relative to both of the units (1) and (2) were equally useful in accurately classifying single and geminate stops. This implies that the anchor to which the contrasting stop duration normalizes across rates does not have to be the entire word although the word is also a stable anchor.\n",

    "Recent studies have shown that talkers implicitly imitate/accommodate the phonetic properties of recently heard speech (e.g., Goldinger 1998; Pardo, 2006). However, it has also been shown that this phonetic imitation effect is not an automatic process: in Nielsen (2008), the artificially lengthened VOT on /p/ was imitated in a non-shadowing task, while shortened VOT (which could jeopardize phonemic contrast) was not imitated. The current study explores the extent to which phonological factors unrelated to contrast preservation also affect imitation of phonetic details, specifically, Japanese vowel devoicing. The results revealed significant imitation of Japanese devoicing, indicating that even in phonologically constrained environments, perceived fine phonetic details are imitable and can subsequently affect speech production .\n",

    "Voiceless geminate stops in Italian are typically described as unaspirated in all positions. However, recent acoustic phonetic analysis of part of a corpus of standard Italian speech data has shown that the geminate voiceless stops /pp tt kk/ are frequently realized with both preaspiration i.e. [hC] and post-aspiration. This paper focuses on the latter phenomenon, presenting acoustic phonetic evidence in the form of VOT duration values for /pp tt kk/ tokens recorded in 15 Italian cities (based on the CLIPS corpus of spoken Italian). The co-occurrence of post-aspiration with preaspiration is considered and results are discussed with a focus on regional patterns.\n",

    "Southern Salentino has a harmony process, where the stressed mid vowels /E, O/ are raised to the mid-high vowels /e, o/ when followed by -i or -u. We studied this process by combining acoustic analyses with ultrasound tongue imaging. The main result of our study is that the Southern Salentino harmonic adjustments in height, which are acoustically manifested in the differentiation of F1, are articulatorily correlated with tongue root advancement when the process is triggered by -i and with tongue body raising when the process is triggered by -u. We propose a phonological analysis of the process based on these findings.\n",

    "Realtime MRI provides useful data about the human vocal tract, but also introduces many of the challenges of processing high-dimensional image data. Intuitively, data reduction would proceed by finding the air-tissue boundaries in the images, and tracing an outline of the vocal tract. This approach is anatomically well-founded. We explore an alternative approach which is data-driven and has a complementary set of advantages. Our method directly examines pixel intensities. By analyzing how the pixels co-vary over time, we segment the image into spatially localized regions, in which the pixels are highly correlated with each other. Intensity variations in these correlated regions correspond to vocal tract constrictions, which are meaningful units of speech production. We show how these regions can be extracted entirely automatically, or with manual guidance. We present two examples and discuss its merits, including the opportunity to do direct data-driven time series modeling.\n",

Tissue boundaries are identified by finding pixel intensity thresholds along tract-normal gridlines. Airway contours are constrained with respect to a tract centerline defined as an optimal path over the graph of all intensity minima identified between the glottis and lips. The method allows for superimposition of reference boundaries to guide automatic segmentation of anatomical features which are poorly imaged using magnetic resonance -- dentition and the hard palate -- resulting in more accurate sagittal sections than those produced by fully automatic segmentation.

    "In speech research using real-time magnetic resonance imaging (RT-MRI), frame reconstruction is typically performed with a constant temporal resolution. However, a flexible selection of temporal resolution is desirable because of natural variations in speaking rate and variations in the speed of different articulators. In this work, a novel spiral golden-ratio temporal view order was applied to nasal RT-MRI studies in imaging a mid-sagittal slice of the upper airway. Compared to conventional spiral bit-reversed temporal view order scheme, the proposed golden-ratio scheme provides less temporal blurring in the depiction of rapid tongue tip motion with a selection of high temporal resolution. It also provides higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the depiction of relatively slow velar motion with a selection of low temporal resolution.\n",

    "This paper investigates different statistical modeling frameworks for articulatory speech data obtained using real-time (RT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To quantitatively capture the spatio-temporal shaping process of the human vocal tract during speech production a multi-dimensional stream of image features is derived from the MRI recordings. The features are closely related, though not identical, to the tract variables commonly defined in the articulatory phonology theory. The modeling of the shaping process aims at decomposing the articulatory data streams into primitives by segmentation, and the segmentation task is carried out using vector quantizers, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models, and a coupled Hidden Markov Model. We evaluate the performance of the different segmentation schemes qualitatively with the help of a well understood data set which was used in a earlier study of inter-articulatory timing phenomena of American English nasal sounds.\n",

We use various three-mode factor analysis techniques to model the variations of midsagittal vocal tract contours obtained from MRI images for three French speakers articulating 73 vowels and consonants. Articulations of a given speaker for phonemes not present in the training set are then predicted by inversion of the models from measurements of these phonemes articulated by the other subjects. On the average, the prediction RMSE was 5.25 mm for tongue contours, and 3.3 mm for 2D midsagittal vocal tract distances. Besides, this study has established a methodology to determine the optimal number of factors for such models.\n",

Limitations of the recording technology result in most utterances having sequences of frames where one or more pellets are missing. Rather than discarding such sequences, we seek to reconstruct them. We use an algorithm for recovering missing data based on learning a density model of the vocal tract shapes, and predicting missing articulator values using conditional distributions derived from this density. Our results with the Wisconsin X-ray microbeam database show we can recover long, heavily oscillatory trajectories with errors of 1 to 1.5 mm for all articulators.\n",

    "Reconstructing the full contour of the tongue from the position of 3 to 4 landmarks on it is useful in articulatory speech work. This can be done with submillimetric accuracy using nonlinear predictive mappings trained on hundreds or thousands of contours extracted from ultrasound images. Collecting and segmenting this amount of data from a speaker is difficult,so a more practical solution is to adapt a well-trained model from a reference speaker to a new speaker using a small amount of data from the latter. Previous work proposed an adaptation model with only 6 parameters and demonstrated fast, accurate results using data from one speaker only. However, the estimates of this model are biased, and we show that, when adapting to a different speaker, its performance stagnates quickly with the amount of adaptation data. We then propose an unbiased adaptation approach, based on local transformations at each contour point, that achieves a significantly lower reconstruction error with a moderate amount of adaptation data.\n",

It also enables us to examine the differences in VT behaviors as well as inter- and intra-speaker differences across different speech production styles including emotion expression. A set of FDA coefficients can be used as a feature vector of a given VT contour for further modeling. The efficacy of such feature vectors is tested using the Fisher linear discriminant analysis. A cross-validation accuracy of 65.0% was obtained in the task of discriminating four different emotions with combined data points from two speakers.\n",

    "Task-space control is well studied in modeling speech production. Implementing control of this kind requires an accurate kinematic forward model. Despite debate about how to define the tasks for speech (i.e., acoustical vs. articulatory), a faithful forward model will be complex and infeasible to express analytically. Thus, it is necessary to learn the forward model from data. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have previously been suggested for this. We argue for the use of locally-linear methods, such as Locally-Weighted Regression (LWR). While ANNs are capable of learning complex forward maps, LWR is more appropriate. Common formulations of control assume locally-linearity, whereas ANNs fit a nonlinear model to the entire map. Likewise, training LWR is simple compared to the complex optimization for ANNs. We provide an empirical comparison of these methods for learning a vocal tract forward model, discussing theoretical and practical aspects of each.\n",

    "Ultrasonic speech is a novel technology, which implies exciting human vocal tract (VT) with an ultrasonic signal to provide a speech mode in the ultrasonic frequency range. This has several applications including speech-aid prostheses for voice-loss patients, silent speech interfaces, secure mode of communication in mobile phones and speech therapy. Linear prediction has recently been proven to be applicable for feature extraction of ultrasonic propagation inside the VT. The authors have proposed that averaging the predictor coefficients obtained from multiple receiving points is a viable approach for autoregressive (AR) modelling of ultrasonic speech. In support of the previous theoretical work, this paper presents experimental results of implementing the averaging method, using finite element analysis of ultrasonic propagation inside the VT configuration for nine English vowels. A Comparison of the results with the conventional method of least squares error (LSE) -used in room acoustics- shows that averaging outperforms LSE in terms of determining the location of poles in the AR modelling of ultrasonic speech and demonstrates higher robustness to variations of the LPC order.\n",

    "Harsh acoustic conditions limit the effectiveness of human speech communication to a great extent. There is a consensus that even at moderate SNR levels, traditional speech enhancement techniques tend to improve the perceptual quality of speech rather than its intelligibility. As an alternative, non-acoustic contact sensors have recently been developed for noise-robust signal capture. Although relatively immune to ambient noise, due to alternative pickup location and non-acoustic principle of operation, signals measured from these sensors are of lower speech quality and intelligibility when compared to those obtained from a conventional microphone in clean conditions. To facilitate human-to-human speech communication under acoustically adverse environments, in this study we present and evaluate a probabilistic transformation framework to improve perceptual quality and intelligibility of signals acquired from one such sensor entitled: physiological microphone (PMIC). Results from both objective and subjective tests confirm that incorporating this framework as a post-processing stage yields significant improvement in overall quality and intelligibility of PMIC signals.\n",

This paper proposes another speaking-aid system with an air-pressure sensor to enable laryngectomees to control F0 contours of the EL speech using their breathing air. The experimental result demonstrates that 1) the correlation coefficient of F0 contours between the converted and the target speech is improved from 0.58 to 0.78 by the use of the air-pressure sensor and 2) the synthetic speech converted by the proposed system sounds more natural and is more preferred to that by our conventional aid system.\n",

    "It has been shown that large gains in speech intelligibility can be obtained by using the binary mask approach which retains the time-frequency (T-F) units of the mixture signal that are stronger than the interfering noise (masker) (i.e., SNR>0 dB), and removes the T-F units where the interfering noise dominates. In this paper, we introduce a new binary mask for improving speech intelligibility based on noise distortion constraints. A binary mask is designed to retain noise overestimated T-F units while discarding noise underestimated T-F units. Listening tests were conducted to evaluate the new binary mask in terms of intelligibility. Results from the listening tests indicated that large gains in intelligibility can be achieved by the application of the proposed binary mask to noise-corrupted speech even at extremely low SNR levels (-10 dB).\n",

    "Speech output, whether live, recorded or synthetic, is often employed in difficult listening conditions. Context-sensitive speech modifications aim to promote intelligibility while maintaining quality and listener comfort. The current study used objective measures of intelligibility and quality to compare five energy reallocation strategies operating under equal energy and preserved duration constraints. Results in both stationary and highly-nonstationary backgrounds suggest that time-varying modifications lead to large increases in objective intelligibility, but that speech quality is best preserved by time-invariant modifications. Selective amplification of time-frequency regions with low a priori SNR produced the highest objective intelligibility without severe disruption to quality.\n",

Prior information is obtained from existing rapid adaptation techniques like VTLN and PCMLLR.

In this work, an approach to log-linear affine feature transforms for speaker adaptation is described. Experiments for both supervised and unsupervised adaptation are presented, showing improvements over a maximum likelihood baseline in the form of feature space maximum likelihood linear regression for the case of supervised adaptation.\n",

There is significant performance degradation of a baseline system trained on only US data when confronted with shows from other regions. The results improve significantly when data from all the regions are included for accent-independent acoustic model training. Further improvements are achieved when MAP-adapted accent-dependent models are used in conjunction with a GMM accent classifier.\n",

Our new JAC-UT method differentiates itself from other UT-based approaches in that it combines the online noise and channel distortion estimation and model parameter adaptation in a unified UT framework. Experimental results on the standard Aurora 2 task show that the new algorithm enjoys 20.0% and 16.9% relative word error rate reductions over the previous JAC-VTS algorithm when using the simple and complex backend models, respectively.\n",

    "We recently proposed a method for HMM adaptation to noisy environments called Linear Spline Interpolation (LSI). LSI uses linear spline regression to model the relationship between clean and noisy speech features. In the original algorithm, stereo training data was used to learn the spline parameters that minimize the error between the predicted and actual noisy speech features. The estimated splines are then used at runtime to adapt the clean HMMs to the current environment. While good results can be obtained with this approach, the performance is limited by the fact that the splines are trained independently from the speech recognizer and as such, they may actually be suboptimal for adaptation. In this work, we introduce a new Generalized EM algorithm for estimating the spline parameters using the speech recognizer itself. Experiments on the Aurora 2 task show that using LSI adaptation with splines trained in this manner results in a 20% improvement over the original LSI algorithm that used splines estimated from stereo data and a 28% improvement over VTS adaptation.\n",

This challenge, to a large extent, lies in the high degree of uncertainty in pronunciations of OOV terms. In previous work, we presented a stochastic pronunciation modeling (SPM) approach to compensate for this uncertainty. A shortcoming of our original work, however, is that the SPM was based on a joint-multigram model (JMM), which is suboptimal. In this paper, we propose to use conditional random fields (CRFs) for letter-to-sound conversion, which significantly improves quality of the predicted pronunciations. When applied to OOV STD, we achieve considerable performance improvement with both a 1-best system and an SPM-based system.\n",

To remedy the problem of unmatched acoustic models with respect to spoken utterances produced under different acoustic conditions, which may give relatively poor recognition output, we integrate the relevance scores derived from the lattices with the DTW distances derived from the feature space of MFCC parameters or phonetic posteriorgrams. These DTW distances are evaluated for a carefully selected set of pseudo-relevant utterances, which obtained from the first-pass returned list given by the search engine. The utterances on the first-pass returned list are then reranked accordingly and finally shown to the user. Very encouraging, performance improvements were obtained in the preliminary experiments, especially when the acoustic models are poorly matched to the spoken utterances.\n",

    "The spoken term discovery task takes speech as input and identifies terms of possible interest. The challenge is to perform this task efficiently on large amounts of speech with zero resources (no training data and no dictionaries), where we must fall back to more basic properties of language. We find that long (~1 s) repetitions tend to be contentful phrases (e.g. University of Pennsylvania) and propose an algorithm to search for these long repetitions without first recognizing the speech. To address efficiency concerns, we take advantage of (i) sparse feature representations and (ii) inherent low occurrence frequency of long content terms to achieve orders-of-magnitude speedup relative to the prior art. We frame our evaluation in the context of spoken document information retrieval, and demonstrate our method's competence at identifying repeated terms in conversational telephone speech.\n",

A speech recognition engine that uses a language model and pronunciation dictionary built from such an inventory of subword units is completely independent from the information retrieval task. The recognition engine can remain fixed, making this approach ideal for resource constrained systems. In addition, we demonstrate that recall results at higher out of vocabulary (OOV) rates are much superior for the subword unit system. On a music lyrics task at 80% OOV, the subword-based recall is 75.2%, compared to 47.4% for a word system.\n",

    "Extractive speech summarization can be thought of as a decision-making process where the summarizer attempts to select a subset of informative sentences from the original document. Meanwhile, a sentence being selected as part of a summary is typically determined by three primary factors: significance, relevance and redundancy. To meet these specifications, we recently presented a novel probabilistic framework stemming from the Bayes decision theory for extractive speech summarization. It not only inherits the merits of several existing summarization techniques but also provides a flexible mechanism to render the redundancy and coherence relationships among sentences and between sentences and the whole document, respectively. In this paper, we propose several new approaches to the ranking strategy and modeling paradigm involved in such a framework. All experiments reported were carried out on a broadcast news speech summarization task; very promising results were demonstrated.\n",

    "This paper reports our recent exploration of the layer-by-layer learning strategy for training a multi-layer generative model of patches of speech spectrograms. The top layer of the generative model learns binary codes that can be used for efficient compression of speech and could also be used for scalable speech recognition or rapid speech content retrieval. Each layer of the generative model is fully connected to the layer below and the weights on these connections are pre-trained efficiently by using the contrastive divergence approximation to the log likelihood gradient. After layer-by-layer pre-training we unroll the generative model to form a deep auto-encoder, whose parameters are then fine-tuned using back-propagation. To reconstruct the full-length speech spectrogram, individual spectrogram segments predicted by their respective binary codes are combined using an overlap-and-add method. Experimental results on speech spectrogram coding demonstrate that the binary codes produce a log-spectral distortion that is approximately 2 dB lower than a sub-band vector quantization technique over the entire frequency range of wide-band speech.\n",

    "Sparse Component Analysis is a relatively young technique that relies upon representation of a signal occupying only a small part of a larger space. Mixtures of sparse components are disjoint in that space. As a particular application of sparsity of speech signals, we investigate the DUET blind source separation algorithm in the context of speech recognition for multi-party recordings. We show how DUET can be tuned to the particular case of speech recognition with interfering sources, and evaluate the limits of performance as the number of sources increases. We show that the separated speech fits a common metric for sparsity, and conclude that sparsity assumptions lead to good performance in speech separation and hence ought to benefit other aspects of the speech recognition chain.\n",

    "This paper examines the association between the variability of the speech signal inside an analysis frame and the relative difficulty of classifying that frame. We introduce a novel measure of speech frame variability and show through classification experiments that this measure is a strong predictor of classifiability, even when conditioning on the distance to segment boundaries. Finally, we show how to incorporate the measure as weights in the discriminant function of a GMM-HMM recognizer, thereby increasing the relative importance of low variability frames in both decoding and training. This is shown to give a reduction in error rates.\n",

This ignores the inherent temporal continuity that is present in speech and can degrade the subjective quality. In this paper, we propose to optimize the speech feature sequence after a frame-based conversion algorithm has been applied. In particular, we select the sequence of speech features through the minimization of a cost function that involves both the conversion error and the smoothness of the sequence. The estimation problem is solved using sequential Monte Carlo methods. Both subjective and objective results show the effectiveness of the method.\n",

    "Statistical methods for voice conversion are usually based on a single model selected in order to represent a tradeoff between goodness of fit and complexity. In this paper we assume that the best model may change over time, depending on the source acoustic features. We present a new method for spectral voice conversion called Dynamic Model Selection (DMS), in which a set of potential best models with increasing complexity - including a mixture of Gaussian and probabilistic principal component analyzers - are considered during the conversion of a source speech signal into a target speech signal. This set is built during the learning phase, according to the Bayes information criterion (BIC). During the conversion, the best model is dynamically selected among the models in the set, according to the acoustical features of each source frame. Subjective tests show that the method improves the conversion in terms of proximity to the target and quality.\n",

In the proposed technique, an input speech utterance of source speaker is decoded into phonetic and prosodic symbol sequences, and then the converted speech is generated from the pre-trained target speaker's HMM using the decoded information. To reduce the required amount of training data, we use speaker-independent model in the decoding of the input speech, and model adaptation for the training of target speaker's model. Experimental results show that there is no need to prepare the source speaker's training data, and the proposed technique with only ten sentences of the target speaker's adaptation data outperforms the conventional GMM-based one using parallel data of 200 sentences.\n",

    "This paper describes a novel approach to voice conversion using both a joint density model and a speaker model. In voice conversion studies, approaches based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with a joint density model are widely used to estimate a transformation. However, for sufficient quality, they require a parallel corpus which contains plenty of utterances with the same linguistic content spoken by both the speakers. In addition, the joint density GMM methods often suffer from over-training effects when the amount of training data is small. To compensate for these problems, we propose a novel approach to integrate the speaker GMM of the target with the joint density model using probabilistic formulation. The proposed method trains the joint density model and the speaker model, independently. It eases the burden on the source speaker. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when the amount of the parallel corpus is small.\n",

Some advanced methods transform pitch contours instead, but require either parallel training data or syllabic annotations. We propose a method which retains the simplicity and text-independence of the frame-level conversion while yielding high-quality conversion. We achieve these goals by (1) introducing a text-independent tri-frame alignment method, (2) including delta features of F0 into Gaussian mixture model (GMM) conversion and (3) reducing the well-known GMM oversmoothing effect by F0 histogram equalization. Our objective and subjective experiments on the CMU Arctic corpus indicate improvements over both the mean/variance normalization and the baseline GMM conversion.\n",

    "High quality speech-to-lips conversion, investigated in this work, renders realistic lips movement (video) consistent with input speech (audio) without knowing its linguistic content. Instead of memoryless frame-based conversion, we adopt maximum likelihood estimation of the visual parameter trajectories using an audio-visual joint Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We propose a minimum converted trajectory error approach (MCTE) to further refine the converted visual parameters. First, we reduce the conversion error by training the joint audio-visual GMM with weighted audio and visual likelihood. Then MCTE uses the generalized probabilistic descent algorithm to minimize a conversion error of the visual parameter trajectories defined on the optimal Gaussian kernel sequence according to the input speech. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods using the LIPS 2009 Visual Speech Synthesis Challenge dataset, without knowing the linguistic (phonetic) content of the input speech.\n",

What has been missing in the previous studies, however, is a comparison with neutral-focus, in addition to main focus and pre/post-focus, which is necessary to elucidate a precise phonetic status of second occurrence focus. Using evidence from Japanese, this study shows that second occurrence focus in the pre/post-focus position is realized with high pitch less salient than main focus but more than pre/post-focus. Compared with neutral-focus, the pitch of second occurrence focus is higher in the pre-focus position but lower in the post-focus position due to post-focus compression. Furthermore, this study provides a cross-linguistic insight of focus realization. The result suggests that Japanese focus experiences pre-focus compression, in addition to post-focus compression, which is different from Korean, English, and Mandarin.\n",

It is found that (1) the length of RC greatly impacts ambiguity resolutions offline; (2) Prosodic grouping can well reflect the different attachment readings and is consciously used to produce contrastive meanings (3) Online processing can be affected by manipulating the grouping cues: Prominence and pause. The findings support the IPH, and contribute to our understanding about prosodic grouping in Mandarin, which can be applied in spoken language processing.\n",

    "Recently, an increasing attention has been paid to Mandarin word stress which is important for improving the naturalness of speech synthesis. Most of the research on Mandarin speech synthesis focuses on three stress levels: stressed, regular and unstressed. This paper emphasizes the unstressed syllable prediction because the unstressed syllable is also important to the intelligibility of the synthetic speech. Similar as the prosodic structure, it is not easy to detect the stress from text analysis due to the complicated context information. A method based on Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model has been proposed to predict the unstressed syllables with the high accuracy of 85%. The method has been finally applied into the TTS system. The experiment shows that the MOS score of synthetic speech has been improved by 0.35; the pitch contour of the new synthesized speech is also closer to natural speech.\n",

In text-readout speech, pauses occur unconditionally at sentence boundaries and with high probability at major syntactic boundaries such as clause boundaries, but more or less arbitrarily at minor syntactic boundaries. Pause duration tends to be longer at the end of a longer syntactic unit. A detailed analysis is conducted for sentence-medial pauses for readout speech of Bangla. Based on the results, linear models (with variables of syntactic unit length and distance to directly modifying word) are constructed for pause occurrence and duration. The models are evaluated using the test data not included in the analyzed data (open-test condition). The results show that the proposed models can predict occurrence probability for 87% of phrase boundaries correctly, and pause duration within ±100 ms for 80% of the cases.\n",

Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of different features, speaker dependency and variation, different classifiers, and contextual information. Our experiments on the Boston University Radio News Corpus show that although the cepstral features alone do not perform well, when combined with prosodic features they yield some performance gain and, more importantly, can reduce much of the speaker variation in this task. We find that the previous context is more informative than the following context, and their combination achieves the best performance.

Therefore, the F0 pattern of SC presents itself to observe the nuclear prominence and pre-nuclear prominence classification as in English.

    "This paper presents an approach to estimating word level prominence in Swedish using syllable level features. The paper discusses the mismatch problem of annotations between word level perceptual prominence and its acoustic correlates, context, and data scarcity. 200 sentences are annotated by 4 speech experts with prominence on 3 levels. A linear model for feature extraction is proposed on a syllable level features, and weights for these features are optimized to match word level annotations. We show that using syllable level features and estimating weights for the acoustic correlates to minimize the word level estimation error gives better detection accuracy compared to word level features, and that both features exceed the baseline accuracy.\n",

    "This paper describes the application of the Momel algorithm to a corpus of spontaneous speech in Standard (Beijing) Chinese. A selection of utterances by four speakers was analysed automatically and the resynthesised utterances were evaluated subjectively with two categories of errors: lexical tone errors and intonation errors. The target points determining the pitch contours of the synthetic utterances were then corrected manually in order to obtain a set of acceptable utterances for the entire corpus. An application attempting to optimise window-size for the Momel algorithm showed no overall improvement with respect to the manually corrected data. This annotated data will nevertheless constitute a useful yardstick for evaluating improvements to the automatic algorithm which is expected to be far more robust than data annotated for languages with no lexical tone.\n",

    "As a high-level feature, prosody may be an effective feature when it is modeled over longer ranges than the typical range of a syllable. This paper is about language recognition with the high-level prosodic attributes. It studies two important issues of long-range modeling, namely the data scarcity handling method, and the model which properly describes prosodic boundary events. Illustrated by NIST language recognition evaluation (LRE) 2009, long-range modeling is shown to bring a 7.2% relative improvement to a prosodic language detector. Score fusion between the long-range prosodic system and a phonotactic system gives an EER of 3.07%. Exploiting boundary N-grams is the main contributing factor to global EER reduction, while different long-range prosodic modeling factors benefit the detection of different languages. Analysis reveals the evidence of language-specific long-range prosodic attributes, which sheds light on robust long-range modeling methods for language recognition.\n",

Although widely used in synthesis, it is subject to certain limitations, including mathematical over-determinacy, and insufficiency for some naturally occurring forms. We propose an alternative parameterization which separates declination and phrasal height, thereby making mathematical properties of phrase control symmetric to accent control. The modification improves the models utility for analysis, predictive synthesis, and rule-based synthesis, esp. when command dependent attenuation factors are used. An evaluation of the modified F0 generation on a speech corpus, based on experiments with the DRESS synthesizer, shows lower RMSE values and similar correlations between natural contours and their synthesized counterparts.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose two different language modeling approaches, namely skip trigram and across sentence boundary, to capture the long range dependencies. The skip trigram model is able to cover more predecessor words of the present word compared to the normal trigram while the same memory space is required. The across sentence boundary model uses the word distribution of the previous sentences to calculate the unigram probability which is applied as the emission probability in the word and the class model frameworks. Our experiments on the Penn Treebank show that each of our proposed models and also their combination significantly outperform the baseline for both the word and the class models and their linear interpolation. The linear interpolation of the word and the class models with the proposed skip trigram and across sentence boundary models achieves 118.4 perplexity while the best state-of-the-art language model has a perplexity of 137.2 on the same dataset.\n",

    "This paper investigates the impact of word classing on a recently proposed shrinkage-based language model, Model M. Model M, a class-based n-gram model, has been shown to significantly outperform word-based n-gram models on a variety of domains. In past work, word classes for Model M were induced automatically from unlabeled text using the algorithm of Brown et. al. We take a closer look at the classing and attempt to find out whether improved classing would also translate to improved performance. In particular, we explore the use of manually-assigned classes, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and dialog state information, considering both hard classing and soft classing. In experiments with a conversational dialog system (human--machine dialog) and a speech-to-speech translation system (human--human dialog), we find that better classing can improve Model M performance by up to 3% absolute in word-error rate.\n",

By normalizing text displayed in a web interface, internet users provide a parallel corpus of normalized and non-normalized text. With this corpus, SMT models are generated to translate non-normalized into normalized text. To build traditional language-specific text normalization systems, knowledge of linguistics as well as established computer skills to implement text normalization rules are required. Our systems are built without profound computer knowledge due to the simple self-explanatory user interface and the automatic generation of the SMT models. Additionally, no inhouse knowledge of the language to normalize is required due to the multilingual expertise of the internet community. All techniques are applied on French texts, crawled with our Rapid Language Adaptation Toolkit [1] and compared through Levenshtein edit distance, BLEU score and perplexity.

The similarity between s and each string s' is estimated using co-occurrence statistics. The new P(s) is approximated by smoothing all the similar n-gram probabilities with a regression technique.

    "The amount of available Thai broadcast news transcribed text for training a language model is still very limited, comparing to other major languages. Since the construction of a broadcast news corpus is very costly and time-consuming, newspaper text is often used to increase the size of training text data. This paper proposes a language model topic and style adaptation approach for a Thai broadcast news ASR system, using broadcast news and newspaper text. A rule-based speaking style classification method based on the existence of some specific words is applied to classify training text. Various kinds of language models adapted to topics and styles are studied and shown to successfully reduce test set perplexity and recognition error rate. The results also show that written style text from newspaper can be employed to alleviate the sparseness of the broadcast news corpus while spoken style text from the broadcast news corpus is still essential for building a reliable language model.\n",

While much effort in language modeling research has been directed at designing better models or smoothing techniques for n-gram language models, in this paper we take the approach of augmenting the context in the n-gram model with different sources of information. We start by adding word class labels to the context. The word classes are automatically derived from un-annotated training data. As a contrast, we also experiment with POS tags which require a tagger trained on annotated data. An amalgam of these two methods uses class labels defined on word and POS tag combinations. Other context features include super-tags derived from the syntactic tree structure as well as semantic features derived from PropBank. Experiments on the DARPA GALE Arabic speech recognition task show that augmented context features often improve both perplexity and word error rate.\n",

Previously, we have shown that TDC models outperform several state-of-the-art baseline models. There are two separate points that we would like to introduce in this paper. First, we improve the TDC model further by incorporating a cache-based LM through unigram scaling. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Japanese newspaper (Mainichi Shimbun) corpora show that this combination improves the model significantly in terms of perplexity. Second, a TDC stand-alone model suffers from a shrinking training corpus as the number of topics increases. We solve this problem by performing soft-clustering and soft-voting in the training and test phases. Experimental results using the WSJ corpus show that the TDC model outperforms the baseline without interpolation with a word-based n-gram.\n",

Manually derived patterns and models appear to be very useful and not difficult to obtain by generalizing significant examples fetched by the presence of specific semantic constituents.\n",

    "A new approach for computing weights of topic models in language model (LM) adaptation is introduced. We formed topic clusters by a hard-clustering method assigning one topic to one document based on the maximum number of words chosen from a topic for that document in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis. The new weighting idea is that the unigram count of the topic generated by hard-clustering is used to compute the mixture weights instead of using an LDA latent topic word count used in the literature. Our approach shows significant perplexity and word error rate (WER) reduction against the existing approach.\n",

    "In this paper, we present a systems approach for channel modeling of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. This can have implications in improving speech recognition components, such as through discriminative language modeling. We simulate the ASR corruption using a phrase-based machine translation system trained between the reference phoneme and output phoneme sequences of a real ASR. We demonstrate that local optimization on the quality of phoneme-to-phoneme mappings does not directly translate to overall improvement of the entire model. However, we are still able to capitalize on contextual information of the phonemes which a simple acoustic distance model is not able to accomplish. Hence we show that the use of longer context results in a significantly improved model of the ASR channel.\n",

    "We propose a novel model training method for reranking problems. In our proposed approach, named the round-robin duel discrimination (R2D2), model training is done so that all pairs of samples can be distinguished from each other. The loss function of R2D2 for a log-linear model is concave. Therefore we can easily find the global optimum by using a simple parameter estimation method such a gradient descent method. We also describe the relationships between the global conditional log-linear model (GCLM) and R2D2. R2D2 can be recognized as an expansion of GCLM. We evaluate R2D2 on an error correction language model for speech recognition. Our experimental results using the corpus of spontaneous Japanese show that R2D2 provides an accurate model with a high generalization ability.\n",

    "This paper presents a method for rescoring the speech recognition lattices on-the-fly to increase the word accuracy while preserving low latency of a real-time speech recognition system. In large vocabulary speech recognition systems, pruned and/or lower order n-gram language models are often used in the first-pass of the speech decoder due to the computational complexity. The output word lattices are rescored offline with a better language model to improve the accuracy. For real-time speech recognition systems, offline lattice rescoring increases the latency of the system and may not be appropriate. We propose a method for on-the-fly lattice rescoring and generation, and evaluate it on a broadcast speech recognition task. This first-pass lattice rescoring method can generate rescored lattices with less than 20% increased computation over standard lattice generation without increasing the latency of the system.\n",

A tone identification task was administered before and after training. Both groups had comparable tone identification accuracy; however, Thai listeners obtained greater tone word learning proficiency. The findings suggest that native language experience with employing pitch lexically facilitates the incorporation of non-native tones into novel lexical representations.\n",

    "Aiming at effective perceptual training of second language learning, we carried out training experiments on Japanese geminate consonants. Native Korean learners were trained to identify geminate and singleton stop of Japanese. Since Korean language has no phonemic contrast between long and short consonants, learners have tried to learn their differences based on their categorical perception through training. To test the training efficiency and find generalization of temporal discrimination, we investigated the perceptual training with a word embedded in sentences and single/multiple speaking rate. Training experiments showed the superiority with a word embedded in sentences and multiple speaking rates. These results suggest that perceptual training which was trained by multiple speaking rates could be effective to perceive temporal discrimination of length contrast of Japanese. However, under the training stimuli was single speaking rate condition, perceptual training have generalized to the limited extent. These results suggest that context factors including speaking rate would affect to identify the length contrast of Japanese to L2 learners.\n",

    "This study aims to investigate native speakers perception of prosodic variation of Japanese utterances. The pitch contour above the word level is hard to determine due to individual variation or pragmatic and para-linguistic factors. Nevertheless, native speakers intonation is relatively consistent as long as the context and intention of the utterance is predetermined. On the other hand, L2 speakers intonation contains some prosodic deviation from the native speakers model, and yet some deviations are treated as non-native production and some are not. By identifying the prosodic deviations that are tolerated by native listeners, we will have better understanding of crucial points necessary for the improvement of Japanese pronunciation and the reference for computer-based assessment tools. The study suggests that pitch errors affect the performance score, but not as significantly as do timing errors.\n",

    "This paper examines how the strategies for L2 production utilized by foreign language learners affect the performance of non-native speech recognition. Producing English consonant clusters are the most problematic for Korean learners of English because of difference between Korean and English phonotactics. The strategies of Korean learners in producing English consonant clusters entail a large amount of speech recognition errors. We have analyzed these problems based on phonetic and phonological knowledge of both languages and proposed two models focusing on vowel epenthesis and consonant deletion, respectively. These models reflect Korean learners cluster reduction strategies. Experimental results show that the vowel epenthesis model improves the speech recognition performance compared to the baseline; however, the consonant deletion model deteriorates the speech recognition performance. It is noteworthy that these experimental results are consistent with previous linguistic studies, which have claimed that L2 learners are more likely to avoid producing clusters by vowel epenthesis rather than by consonant deletion.\n",

The participants speech was perceptually judged by six native speakers of Japanese. The results indicate that kinematic feedback with EMA facilitates the acquisition and maintenance of the Japanese flap consonant, providing superior acquisition and maintenance.

We made word and non-word repetition experiments with French- and Drehu-acquiring 2-year-old to 5-year-old children. We first analysed production in words according to frequency data in French and Drehu. Results show that productions of word-initial consonants are correlated with frequency, especially in younger children. Then we compared the non-word production scores of French- and Drehu-acquiring children. French and Drehu learners have similar mean scores but show different patterns for specific phonemes that differ in frequency.\n",

    "We describe a new technique for automatically identifying errors in an electronic pronunciation dictionary which analyzes the source of conflicting patterns directly. We evaluate the effectiveness of this technique in two ways: we perform a controlled experiment using artificially corrupted data (allowing us to measure precision and recall exactly); and then apply the technique to a real-world pronunciation dictionary, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice. We also introduce a new freely available pronunciation resource (the RCRL Afrikaans Pronunciation Dictionary), the largest such dictionary that is currently available.\n",

    "Managing a large-scale speech transcription task with a team of human transcribers requires effective quality control and workload distribution. As it becomes easier and cheaper to collect massive audio corpora the problem is magnified. Relying on expert review or transcribing all speech multiple times is impractical. Furthermore, speech that is difficult to transcribe may be better handled by a more experienced transcriber or skipped entirely. We present a fully automatic system to address these issues. First, we use the system to estimate transcription accuracy from a a single transcript and show that it correlates well with inter-transcriber agreement. Second, we use the system to estimate the transcription \"difficulty\" of a speech segment and show that it is strongly correlated with transcriber effort. This system can help a transcription manager determine when speech segments may require review, track transcriber performance, and efficiently manage the transcription process.\n",

To create the dataset we randomly generate sentences and have them annotated by crowd sourcing over the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Obtaining inter-annotator agreement is a difficult problem because linguistic plausibility is highly subjective. The annotations obtained depend, among other factors, on the manner in which annotators are ques- tioned about the plausibility of sentences. We describe our experi- ments on posing a number of different questions to the annotators, in order to elicit the responses with greatest agreement, and present several methods for analyzing the resulting responses.

    "In this paper we describe the development of an annotated Chinese conversational textual corpus for speech recognition in a speech-to-speech translation system in the travel domain. A total of 515,000 manually checked utterances were constructed, which provided a 3.5 million word Chinese corpus with word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. The annotation is conducted with careful manual checking. The specifications on word segmentation and POS-tagging are designed to follow the main existing Chinese corpora that are widely accepted by researchers of Chinese natural language processing. Many particular features of conversational texts are also taken into account. With this corpus, parallel corpora are obtained together with the corresponding pairs of Japanese and English texts from which the Chinese was translated. To evaluate the corpus, the language models built by it are evaluated using perplexity and speech recognition accuracy as criteria. The perplexity of the Chinese language model is verified as having reached a reasonably low level. Recognition performance is also found to be comparable to the other two languages, even though the quantity of training data for Chinese is only half the other two languages.\n",

Our goal was to produce material which is both natural (derived from reverberant domestic environments with many simultaneous and unpredictable sound sources) and controlled (providing an enumerated range of SNRs spanning 20 dB). The corpus includes around 40 hours of background recordings from a head and torso simulator positioned in a domestic setting, and a comprehensive set of binaural impulse responses collected in the same environment. These have been used to add target utterances from the Grid speech recognition corpus into the CHiME domestic setting. Data has been mixed in a manner that produces a controlled and yet natural range of SNRs over which speech separation, enhancement and recognition algorithms can be evaluated. The paper motivates the design of the corpus, and describes the collection and post-processing of the data. We also present a set of baseline recognition results.\n",

We formulated a hypothesis of the developmental process that there is a connection between physical expression skills and mental conditions such as utterances, gestures and the attention ability. The analysis results showed that the situation understanding skills follow the similar development, which is a change of object-centric to person-centric, despite the age of developmental change is different.

We carried out an empirical analysis with some of the most promising strategies.

Using large-scale logs from a widely deployed spoken system, we analyze on an aggregate level factors that are correlated with a decision to speak a query rather than type it. We find the factors most predictive of spoken queries are whether a query is made from an unconventional keyboard, for a search topic relating to a users' location, or for a search topic that can be answered in a hands-free fashion. We also find, contrary to our intuition, that longer queries have a higher probability of being typed than shorter queries.\n",

    "Combilex is a high-quality lexicon that has been developed specifically for speech technology purposes and recently released by CSTR. Combilex benefits from many advanced features. This paper explores one of these: the ability to generate fully-specified transcriptions for morphologically derived words automatically. This functionality was originally implemented to encode the pronunciations of derived words in terms of their constituent morphemes, thus accelerating lexicon development and ensuring a high level of consistency. In this paper, we propose this method of modelling pronunciations can be exploited further by combining it with a morphological parser, thus yielding a method to generate full transcriptions for unknown derived words. Not only could this accelerate adding new derived words to Combilex, but it could also serve as an alternative to conventional letter-to-sound rules. This paper presents preliminary work indicating this is a promising direction.\n",

    "We present a new phone-dependent feature weighting scheme that can be used to map articulatory configurations (e.g. EMA) onto vocal tract spectra (e.g. MFCC) through table lookup. The approach consists of assigning feature weights according to a features ability to predict the acoustic distance between frames. Since an articulators predictive accuracy is phone-dependent (e.g., lip location is a better predictor for bilabial sounds than for palatal sounds), a unique weight vector is found for each phone. Inspection of the weights reveals a correspondence with the expected critical articulators for many phones. The proposed method reduces overall cepstral error by 6% when compared to a uniform weighting scheme. Vowels show the greatest benefit, though improvements occur for 80% of the tested phones.\n",

    "We present a novel automatic procedure to analyze 'articulatory setting (AS)' or 'basis of articulation' using real-time magnetic resonance images (rt-MRI) of the human vocal tract recorded for read and spontaneously spoken speech. We extract relevant frames of inter-speech pauses (ISPs) and rest positions from MRI sequences of read and spontaneous speech and use automatically-extracted features to quantify areas of different regions of the vocal tract as well as the angle of the jaw. Significant differences were found between the ASs adopted for ISPs in read and spontaneous speech, as well as those between ISPs and absolute rest positions. We further contrast differences between ASs adopted when the person is ready to speak as opposed to an absolute rest position.\n",

We propose a method based on recovering the set of all possible vocal tract shapes as the modes of a conditional density of articulators given acoustics, and then selecting feasible trajectories from this set.

We compare the Multi Linear Regression method (MLR) with two more sophisticated methods based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), using the same French corpus of articulatory data acquired by ElectroMagnetoGraphy. GMMs give overall results better than HMMs, but MLR does poorly. GMMs and HMMs maintain the original phonetic class distribution, though with some centralisation effects, effects still much stronger with MLR. A detailed analysis shows that, if the jaw / lips / tongue tip synergy helps recovering front high vowels and coronal consonants, the velars are not recovered at all. It is therefore not possible to recover reliably tongue from face.\n",

Our spontaneous speech data confirm that French phrase-medial devoicing is a frequent phenomenon affecting high vowels preceded by voiceless consonants. We also found that devoicing is more frequent in temporally reduced and coarticulated vowels. Complete and partial devoicing were conditioned by the same variables (speech rate, consonant type and distance from the end of the AP). Given these results, we propose that phrase-medial vowel devoicing in French arises mainly from the temporal compression of vocalic gestures and the aerodynamic conditions imposed by high vowels.\n",

    "This study investigates the mechanism of tonal contraction when a disyllabic unit is merged into a monosyllable at fast speech rate in Taiwan Mandarin. Various degrees of contraction of bi-tonal sequences were elicited by manipulating speech rates. Functional Data Analysis was performed to compare trajectories of F0 and velocity in the contracted and non-contracted syllables. Preliminary results show that speakers always make an effort to produce the original tones, even in cases of extreme degrees of reduction. This finding militates against phonology-based accounts like the Edge-in model, according to which contraction is a process of deleting adjacent tonemes while leaving the non-adjacent tonemes intact.\n",

    "The cognitive load experienced by a person can be used as an index to monitor task performance. Hence, the ability to measure the cognitive load of a person using speech can potentially be very useful, especially in areas such as air traffic control systems. Current research on cognitive load does not provide enough insight into how cognitive load affects the speech spectrum, or the speech production system. Since formants are closely related to the underlying vocal tract configuration, this work aims to study the effect of cognitive load on vowel formant frequencies, and hence proposes the effective application of formant features to cognitive load classification. Results from classification performed on the Stroop test database show that formant features not only have lower dimensionality, but dynamic formant features can outperform conventionally used MFCC-based features by a relative improvement of 12%.\n",

The carefully controlled phonetic content of the carrier phrase allows for analysis of the role of specific phonetic features, such as phoneme duration, in emotional expression in Dutch and Korean. In this study the mutual effect of language and emotion on phoneme duration is presented.\n",

Each spouse was manually coded with relevant session-level perceptual observations (e.g., level of blame toward other spouse, global positive affect), and our goal was to classify the spouses' behavior using features derived from the audio signal. Based on automatic segmentation, we extracted prosodic/spectral features to capture global acoustic properties for each spouse. We then trained gender-specific classifiers to predict the behavior of each spouse for six codes. We compare performance for the various factors (across codes, gender, classifier type, and feature type) and discuss future work for this novel and challenging corpus.\n",

We report on experimental results obtained with the Aurora-2 connected digit recognition task, and show that a large digit error reduction of 67% from multi-condition training is attainable if the missing side information needed for particle filter based compensation were available. When such nuisance parameters are estimated in actual operational conditions then an error reduction of only 13% is currently achievable.

Second, IBM estimation is formulated using a generalized expectation maximization algorithm directly to optimize the ASR performance. Experimental results show that even in highly non-stationary mismatch condition (dance music as background noise), the proposed method achieves much higher absolute ASR accuracy improvement ranging from 14.69% at 0 dB SNR to 40.10% at 15 dB SNR compared with the conventional noise suppression method.\n",

Moreover, instantaneous prediction of ego-motion noise is the core concept to establish the following techniques: ego-motion noise suppression by template subtraction and missing feature theory based masking of noisy speech features. We evaluate the proposed technique on a robot using speech recognition results. Adaptive superimposition of white noise achieves up to 20% improvement of word correct rates (WCR) and the spectrographic mask attains an additional improvement of up to 10% compared to the single channel recognition.\n",

    "In this paper, a novel technique based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) methodology is proposed and examined for the noise-robustness of automatic speech recognition systems. The EMD analysis is a generalization of the Fourier analysis for processing non-linear and non-stationary time functions, in our case, the speech feature sequences. We use the first and second intrinsic mode functions (IMF), which include the sinusoidal functions as special cases, obtained from the EMD analysis in the post-processing of the log energy feature. Experimental results on the noisy-digit Aurora 2.0 database show that our proposed method leads to significant improvement for the mismatched (clean-training) tasks.\n",

    "This paper proposes an effective feature compensation scheme to address a real-life situation where clean speech database is not available for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) training for a model-based feature compensation method. The proposed scheme employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based model selection method to effectively generate the GMM for our feature compensation method directly from the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of the speech recognizer. We also present a strategy to address the case of a combination with Cepstral Mean Normalization (CMN), where the HMM for speech recognizer is obtained using CMN-processed speech database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at providing a comparable speech recognition performance to the matched data condition where the clean speech database is available for GMM training which is also used for HMM training for speech recognizer. This proves that the SVM-based model selection method is able to effectively generate Gaussian components from the pre-trained HMM model parameters to make the GMM for the feature compensation method be tightly matched to the speech recognizer.\n",

    "Recent research has shown that speech can be sparsely represented using a dictionary of speech segments spanning multiple frames, emph{exemplars}, and that such a sparse representation can be recovered using Compressed Sensing techniques. In previous work we proposed a novel method for noise robust automatic speech recognition in which we modelled noisy speech as a sparse linear combination of speech and noise exemplars extracted from the training data. The weights of the speech exemplars were then used to provide noise robust HMM-state likelihoods. In this work we propose to acquire additional noise exemplars during decoding and the use of a noise dictionary which is artificially constructed. Experiments on AURORA-2 show that the artificial noise dictionary works better for noises not seen during training and that acquiring additional exemplars can improve recognition accuracy.\n",

The first approach, iterative root finding (IRF), directly differentiates the EM auxiliary function and approximates the root of the derivative function through recursive refinements. The second approach, twofold expectation maximization (TEM), estimates noise distributions by regarding them as hidden variables in a modified EM fashion. Mathematical derivations reveal the substantial connection between the two approaches. Two experiments are performed in evaluating the performance and convergence rate of the algorithms. The first is to fit a GMM model to artificially corrupted samples that are generated through Monte Carlo simulation. The second is to perform speech recognition on the Aurora 2 database.\n",

This paper seeks to enable more optimal use of MFT with MFCC features through two approximations of this integral: Numeric integration by linear sampling, and approximation by the integrand's maximum. The former is made feasible through a \"tridiagonal\" approximation of MFCC, based on interpreting MFCC as bandpass-filtering the filterbank vector. The latter is solved through quadratic programming. Their effectiveness is shown for recognizing reverberated TIMIT speech utilizing temporal auditory masking.\n",

Recently, an exemplar-based noise robust ASR approach, called sparse classification (SC), was introduced. While very successfully at lower SNRs, the performance at high SNRs suffered when compared to HMM-based systems. In this work, we propose to use a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to implement an HMM-model that uses both MFCCs and phone predictions extracted from the SC system as input. By doing experiments on the AURORA-2 connected digit recognition task, we show that our approach successfully combines the strengths of both systems, resulting in competitive recognition accuracies at both high and low SNRs.\n",

    "Spoken language conversion (SLC) aims to generate utterances in the voice of a speaker but in a language unknown to them, using speech synthesis systems and speech processing techniques. Previous approaches to SLC have been based on cross-language voice conversion (VC), which has underlying assumptions that ignore phonetic and phonological differences between languages, leading to a reduction in intelligibility of the output. Accent morphing (AM) was proposed as an alternative approach, and its intelligibility performance was investigated in a previous study. AM attempts to preserve the voice characteristics of the target speaker whilst modifying their accent, using phonetic knowledge obtained from a native speaker of the target language. This paper examines AM and VC in terms of how similar the output sounds like the target speaker. AM achieved similarity ratings at least equivalent to VC, but the study highlighted various difficulties in evaluating speaker identity in a SLC context.\n",

    "This paper presents adaptive voice-quality control methods based on one-to-many eigenvoice conversion. To intuitively control the converted voice quality by manipulating a small number of control parameters, a multiple regression Gaussian mixture model (MR-GMM) has been proposed. The MR-GMM also allows us to estimate the optimum control parameters if target speech samples are available. However, its adaptation performance is limited because the number of control parameters is too small to widely model voice quality of various target speakers. To improve the adaptation performance while keeping capability of voice-quality control, this paper proposes an extended MR-GMM (EMR-GMM) with additional adaptive parameters to extend a subspace modeling target voice quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the EMR-GMM yields significant improvements of the adaptation performance while allowing us to intuitively control the converted voice quality.\n",

In this paper, an F0 generation process model is used to re-estimate F0 values in the regions of pitch tracking errors, as well as in unvoiced regions. A prior knowledge of VU is imposed in each Mandarin phoneme and they are used for VU decision. Then the F0 can be modeled within the standard HMM framework.\n",

In this method, different F0 models are used to model the pitch patterns for different prosodic layers (including state, phone, syllable, word, etc), and are combined with an additive structure. In model training, the F0 model for each layer is firstly initialized by using the residual between original F0s and generated F0s from other layers as training data, and then the F0 models of all layers are re-estimated simultaneously under a minimum generation error (MGE) training framework. We investigate the effectiveness of hierarchical F0 modeling with different layer settings, experimental results show that the proposed hierarchical F0 modeling method significantly outperforms the conventional state-based F0 modeling method.\n",

Moreover, the weights of each component of the model, which previously were adjusted manually, are optimized automatically by the MGE training during the re-estimation of the model covariances. Objective evaluation indicated that, although the logF0 contours generated by the models trained with MGE have approximately the same root mean square error and correlation factor as those generated with the baseline models, they present a higher dynamic range. The subjective evaluation shows a small but significant preference for the system trained with MGE.\n",

In this paper, an alternate approach is proposed in which a set of manually written post-lexical effects (PLE) rules modeling a range of continuous speech effects are applied to canonical lexicon pronunciations, and the resulting \"matched PLE\" phone sequences are used both in the voice corpus markup and at synthesis time. For a US English system, a subjective evaluation showed that a system trained on matched PLE markup and a system trained on manual phone markup were equally preferred, suggesting that it may be possible to replace manual pronunciations with matched PLE pronunciations, dramatically decreasing the time and cost required to produce an HMM-TTS voice.\n",

    "In this paper we present a method to predict the movement of a speaker's mouth from text input using hidden Markov models (HMM). We have used a corpus of human articulatory movements, recorded by electromagnetic articulography (EMA), to train HMMs. To predict articulatory movements from text, a suitable model sequence is selected and the maximum-likelihood parameter generation (MLPG) algorithm is used to generate output articulatory trajectories. In our experiments, we find that fully context-dependent models outperform monophone and quinphone models, achieving an average root mean square (RMS) error of 1.945mm when state durations are predicted from text, and 0.872mm when natural state durations are used. Finally, we go on to analyze the prediction error for different EMA dimensions and phone types. We find a clear pattern emerges that the movements of so-called critical articulators can be predicted more accurately than the average performance.\n",

    "In this paper, we present a novel methodology for sports highlight detection based on audio information. For processing the sounds of sports events, we propose a time-frequency feature extraction method computing local auto-correlations on complex Fourier values (FLAC). For highlights detection, we apply (complex) subspace method to the extracted FLAC features to detect the exciting scenes which occur sparsely in a background of ordinary periods. As an unsupervised learning algorithm, the subspace method maintains advantages that any prior knowledge and expensive-computation are not required. To evaluate the proposed method, we made experiments on a soccer match. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach including robustness to environmental noise, low computation burden and promising performance.\n",

    "The problem of automatic excitement detection in baseball videos is considered and applied to highlights generation. This paper focuses on detecting exciting events in the video using complementary information from the audio and video domains. First, a new measure for non-stationarity which is extremely effective in separating background from speech is proposed. This new feature is employed in a unsupervised GMM-based segmentation algorithm that identifies the commentators speech in the crowd background. Thereafter, the ``level-of-excitement'' is measured using features such as pitch, F1-F3 center frequencies, and spectral center of gravity extracted from the commentators speech. Our experiments show that these features are well correlated with human assessment of excitability. Furthermore, slow-motion replay and pitching-scenes from the video are also detected to estimate scene end-points. Finally, audio/video information is fused to rank-order scenes by ``excitability'' and generate highlights of user-defined time-lengths. The techniques described in this paper are generic and applicable to a variety of domains.\n",

    "In this study, a new generic framework for the detection and interpretation of disagreement (incongruence) between different classifiers [15] is applied to the problem of detecting novel acoustic objects in an office environment. Using a general model that detects generic acoustic objects (standing out from a stationary background) and specific models tuned to particular sounds expected in the office, a novel object is detected as an incongruence between the models: the general model detects it as a generic object, but the specific models can not identify it as any of the known office-related sources. The detectors are realized using amplitude modulation spectrogram and RASTA-PLP features with support vector machine classification. Data considered are speech and non-speech sounds embedded in real office background at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from +20 dB to -20 dB. Our approach yields approximately 90% hit rate for novel events at 20 dB SNR, 75% at 0 dB and reaches chance level below -10 dB.\n",

For this reason, some companies are specialized in the monitoring of audio/video streams for validating that ads are broadcast according to what was requested and paid for by the advertiser. The procedure for searching specific ads in an audio stream is very similar to the copy detection task for which we have developed very efficient algorithms. This work reports results of applying our copy detection algorithms to the advertisement detection task. Compared to a commercial software, we detected 18% more advertisements and the system runs at 0.003x of real-time.\n",

    "Speaker diarization systems attempt segmentation and labeling of a conversation between $R$ speakers, while no prior information is given regarding the conversation. Most state of the art diarization systems require the full body of the conversation data prior to the application of some diarization approach. However, for some applications such as forensics, which handles vast amount of data, an on-line or incremental diarization is of high importance. For that purpose, a two-stage incremental diarization of telephone conversations algorithm is suggested. On the first stage, a fully unsupervised diarization algorithm is applied over an initial training segment from the conversation. The second-stage is composed of time-series clustering of increments of the conversation. Applying incremental diarization over 1802 telephone conversations from NIST 2005 SER generated an increase in diarization error of approximately 2% compared to the diarization error of an off-line diarization system\n",

The feature set used is customized for detecting the burst and voicing onsets, and the loss function used in training is the difference between predicted and actual VOT. Applied to initial voiceless stops from two corpora, the algorithm compares favorably to previous work, and the agreement between automatic and manual measurements is near human inter-judge reliability.\n",

    "An application of compressive sensing (CS) theory in image-based robust face recognition is considered. Motivated by CS, the problem has been recently cast in a sparse representation framework: The sparsest linear combination of a query image is sought using all prior training images as an overcomplete dictionary, and the dominant sparse coefficients reveal the identity of the query image. The ability to perform dense error correction directly in the image space also provides an intriguing solution to compensate pixel corruption and improve the recognition accuracy exceeding most existing solutions. Furthermore, a local iterative process can be applied to solve for an image transformation applied to the face region when the query image is misaligned. Finally, we discuss the state of the art in fast algorithms to improve the speed of the system. The paper also provides useful guidelines to practitioners working in similar fields, such as acoustic/speech recognition.\n",

We show that the frame classification accuracy with these new features is 1.3% higher than a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), showing that not only do SRs move test features closer to training, but also move the features closer to the correct class. Given these new SR features, we train up a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on these features and perform recognition. On the TIMIT corpus, we find that applying the SR features on top of our best discriminatively trained system allows for a 0.7% absolute reduction in phonetic error rate (PER), from 19.9% to 19.2%. In fact, after applying model adaptation we reduce the PER to 19.0%, the best results on TIMIT to date. Furthermore, on a large vocabulary 50 hour broadcast news task, we achieve a reduction in word error rate (WER) of 0.3% absolute, demonstrating the benefit of these SR features for large vocabulary.\n",

    "The ability to adapt language models to specific domains from large generic text corpora is of considerable interest to the language modeling community. One of the key challenges is to identify the text material relevant to a domain in the generic text collection. The text selection problem can be cast in a semi-supervised learning framework where the initial hypothesis from a speech recognition system is used to identify relevant training material. We present a novel sparse representation formulation which selects a sparse set of relevant sentences from the training data which match the test set distribution. In this formulation, the training sentences are treated as the columns of the sparse representation matrix and the n-gram counts as the rows. The target vector is the n-gram probability distribution for the test data. A sparse solution to this problem formulation identifies a few columns which can best represent the target test vector, thus identifying the relevant set of sentences from the training data. Rescoring results with the language model built from the data selected using the proposed method yields modest gains on the English broadcast news RT-04 task, reducing the word error rate from 14.6% to 14.4%.\n",

    "Sparse representations (SRs) are often used to characterize a test signal using a few support training examples, and allow the number of supports to be adapted to the specific signal being categorized. Given the good performance of SRs compared to other classifiers for both image and phonetic classification, in this paper, we extend the use of SRs for text classification, a method which has thus far not been explored for this domain. Specifically, we demonstrate how sparse representations can be used for text classification and how their performance varies with the vocabulary size of the document features. In addition, we also show that this method offers promising results over the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, a standard classifier used for text classification, thus introducing an alternative class of methods for text categorization.\n",

    "This paper introduces the sparse auto-associative neural network (SAANN) in which the internal hidden layer output is forced to be sparse. This is achieved by adding a sparse regularization term to the original reconstruction error cost function, and updating the parameters of the network to minimize the overall cost. We show applicability of this network to phoneme recognition by extracting sparse hidden layer outputs (used as features) from a network which is trained using perceptual linear prediction (PLP) cepstral coefficients in an unsupervised manner. Experiments with the SAANN features on a state-of-the-art TIMIT phoneme recognition system show a relative improvement in phoneme error rate of 5.1% over the baseline PLP features.\n",

    "According to articulatory phonology, the gestural score is an invariant speech representation. Though the timing schemes, i.e., the onsets and offsets, of the gestural activations may vary, the ensemble of these activations tends to remain unchanged, informing the speech content. In this work, we propose a pronunciation modeling method that uses a finite state machine to represent the invariance of a gestural score. Given the \"canonical'' gestural score of a word with a known activation timing scheme, the plausible activation onsets and offsets are recursively generated and encoded as a weighted FSM. Speech recognition is achieved by matching the recovered gestural activations to the FSM-encoded gestural scores of different speech contents. We carry out pilot word classification experiments using synthesized data from one speaker. The proposed pronunciation modeling achieves over 90% accuracy for a vocabulary of 139 words with no training observations, outperforming direct use of the \"canonical'' gestural scores.\n",

    "In automatic recognition of non-native proper names, it is critical to be able to handle a variety of different pronunciations. Traditionally, this has been solved by including alternative pronunciation variants in the recognition lexicon at the risk of introducing unwanted confusion between different name entries. In this paper we propose a pronunciation variant selection criterion that aims to avoid this risk by basing its decisions on scores which are calculated according to the minimum classification error (MCE) framework. By comparing the error rate before and after a lexicon change, the selection criterion chooses only the candidates that actually decrease the error rate. Selecting pronunciation candidates in this manner substantially reduces both the error rate and the required number of variants per name compared to a probability-based baseline selection method.\n",

As a representative dictionary, we selected Wiktionary [1] since it is at hand in multiple languages and, in addition to the definitions of the words, many phonetic notations in terms of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) are available. Given word lists in four languages English, French, German, and Spanish, we calculated the percentage of words with phonetic notations in Wiktionary. Furthermore, two quality checks were performed: First, we compared pronunciations from Wiktionary to pronunciations from dictionaries based on the GlobalPhone project, which had been created in a rule-based fashion and were manually cross-checked [2]. Second, we analyzed the impact of Wiktionary pronunciations on automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. French Wiktionary achieved the best pronunciation coverage, containing 92.58% phonetic notations for the French GlobalPhone word list as well as 76.12% and 30.16% for country and international city names. In our ASR systems evaluation, the Spanish system gained the most improvement from Wiktionary pronunciations with 7.22% relative word error rate reduction.

    "A lexicon containing explicit mappings between words and pronunciations is an integral part of most automatic speech recognizers (ASRs). While many ASR components can be trained or adapted using data, the lexicon is one of the few that typically remains static until experts make manual changes. This work takes a step towards alleviating the need for manual intervention by integrating a popular grapheme-to-phoneme conversion technique with acoustic examples to automatically learn high-quality baseform pronunciations for unknown words. We explore two models in a Bayesian framework, and discuss their individual advantages and shortcomings. We show that both are able to generate better-than-expert pronunciations with respect to word error rate on an isolated word recognition task.\n",

A supervised end-of-speaker-turn prediction framework, based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks and automatically extracted multimodal features (related to prosody, overlapping speech, and visual motion), was also investigated. These novel approaches resulted in good floor holder detection rates (13.2% Floor Error Rate), attaining state of the art end-of-speaker-turn prediction performances.\n",

    "The Factor Analysis framework demonstrated its high power to model session variability during the past years. However, train- ing the FA parameters implies to have a large amount of training data. When the size of the available database is limited, the number of components of the core statistical model, the UBM, is also limited as the UBM drives the dimension of the FA main matrix. As the size of the UBM gives directly the size of the speaker supervector (concatenation of the GMM mean parameters), it limits also the intrinsic capacity of the recognition system, reducing the performance expectation. This paper aims to withdraw this limitation by breaking the intrinsic link between the FA dimensionality and the UBM dimensionality. The session variability modelling is done on a smaller dimension compared to the UBM, which drives the discriminative power of the system. The first experimental results proposed in this paper, done using the NIST-SRE 2008 framework, are encouraging with a relative EER improvement of about 18% when a 512 components UBM is associated to a 32 components session variability modelling compared with a 32 components UBM associated with the same variability modelling.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a segment-based non-parametric method of monophone recognition. We pre-segment the speech utterance into its underlying phonemes using a group-delay-based algorithm. Then, we apply the k- NN/SASH phoneme classification technique to classify the hypothesized phonemes. Since phoneme boundaries are already known during the decoding, the search space is very limited and the recognition fast. However, such hard-decisioning leads to missed boundaries and over-segmentations. Therefore, while constructing the graph for an utterance, we use phoneme duration constraints and broad-class similarity information to merge or split the segments and create new branches. We perform a simplified acoustical level monophone recognition task on the TIMIT test database. Since phoneme transitional probabilities are not included, only one (most likely) hypothesis and score is provided for each segment and a simple shortest path search algorithm is applied to find the best phoneme sequence rather than the Viterbi search. This simplified evaluation achieves 58.5% accuracy and 67.8% correctness.\n",

    "Acoustic event detection becomes a difficult task, even for a small number of events, in scenarios where events are produced rather spontaneously and often overlap in time. In this work, we aim to improve the detection rate by means of feature selection. Using a one-against-all detection approach, a new fast one-pass-training algorithm, and an associated highly-precise metric are developed. Choosing a different subset of multimodal features for each acoustic event class, the results obtained from audiovisual data collected in the UPC multimodal room show an improvement in average detection rate with respect to using the whole set of features.\n",

    "Research on environmental sound recognition has not shown great development in comparison with that on speech and musical signals. One of the reasons is that the category of environmental sounds covers a broad range of acoustical natures. We classified them in order to explore suitable recognition techniques for each characteristic. We focus on impulsive sounds and their non-stationary feature within and between analytic frames. We used matching-pursuit as a framework to use wavelet analysis for extracting temporal variation of audio features inside a frame. We also investigated the validity of modeling decaying patterns of sounds using Hidden Markov Models. Experimental results indicate that sounds with multiple impulsive signals are recognized better by using time-frequency analyzing bases than by frequency domain analysis. Classification of sound classes with a long and clear decaying pattern improves when multiple number of HMMs are applied.\n",

    "Two new approaches to feature extraction for automatic emotion classification in speech are described and tested. The methods are based on recent laryngological experiments testing the glottal air flow during phonation. The proposed approach calculates the area under the spectral energy envelope of the speech signal (AUSEES) and the glottal waveform (AUSEEG). The new methods provided very high recognition rates for seven emotions (contempt, angry, anxious, dysphoric, pleasant, neutral and happy). The speech data included 170 adult speakers (95 female and 75 male). The classification results showed that the new features provided significantly higher classification results (89.95% for AUSEEG, 76.07% for AUSEES) compared to the baseline MFCC approach (37.81%). The glottal waveform based AUSEEG features provided better results than the speech based AUSEES features, indicating that the majority of the emotion information is likely to be added to speech during the glottal wave formation.\n",

We use bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) networks which, unlike most other emotion recognition approaches, exploit long-range contextual information for modeling the evolution of emotion within a conversation. We focus on recognizing dimensional emotional labels, which enables us to classify both prototypical and non-prototypical emotional expressions contained in a large audio-visual database. Subject-independent experiments on various classification tasks reveal that the BLSTM network approach generally prevails over standard classification techniques such as Hidden Markov Models or Support Vector Machines, and achieves F1-measures of the order of 72%, 65%, and 55% for the discrimination of three clusters in emotional space and the distinction between three levels of valence and activation, respectively.\n",

    "Practical supervised learning scenarios involving subjectively evaluated data have multiple evaluators, each giving their noisy version of the hidden ground truth. Majority logic combination of labels assumes equally skilled evaluators, and is generally suboptimal. Previously proposed models have assumed data independent evaluator behavior. This paper presents a data dependent evaluator model, and an algorithm to jointly learn evaluator behavior and a classifier. This model is based on the intuition that real world evaluators have varying performance depending on the data. Experiments on an emotional valence classification task show modest performance improvements of the proposed algorithm as compared to the majority logic baseline and a data independent evaluator model. But more critically, the algorithm also provides accurate estimates of individual evaluator performance, thus paving the way for incorporating active learning, evaluator feedback and unreliable data detection.\n",

    "In this paper, we model the underlying probability density function (PDF) of the speech line spectral frequencies (LSF) parameters with a Dirichlet mixture model (DMM). The LSF parameters have two special features: 1) the LSF parameters have a bounded range; 2) the LSF parameters are in an increasing order. By transforming the LSF parameters to the ?LSF parameters, the DMM can be used to model the ?LSF parameters and take the advantage of the features mentioned above. The distortion-rate (D-R) relation is derived for the Dirichlet distribution with the high rate assumption. A bit allocation strategy for DMM is also proposed. In modelling the LSF parameters extracted from the TIMIT database, the DMM shows a better performance compared to the Gaussian mixture model, in terms of D-R relation, likelihood and model complexity. Since modelling is the essential and prerequisite step in the PDF-optimized vector quantizer design, better modelling results indicate a superior quantization performance.\n",

Meanwhile, by following the principles of probability density function (PDF) optimized vector quantization (VQ), we derive the bit allocation strategy for the BMM. The LSF parameters are obtained from the TIMIT database and a practical VQ is designed. By taking the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the square error (SE) and the spectral distortion (SD) as the criteria, the BMM based VQ outperforms the Gaussian mixture model based VQ with uncorrelated Gaussian component (UGMVQ) by about 1 ~ 2 bits/vector.\n",

Experimental results obtained on a large vocabulary task show an improved performance of PVQ-MLP in terms of prediction gain and WER compared to a linear prediction scheme, especially when low bit-rates are evaluated. Using PVQ-MLP the bit-rate can be reduced up to 1.8 kbps resulting in a reduction of 66% with respect to the ETSI standards (4.4 kbps) with a WER degradation lower than 5% compared to a system without quantization.\n",

    "This paper presents a forward error correction (FEC) technique based on a multipulse representation of the excitation for code-excited linear prediction (CELP) speech transmission under packet loss conditions. In this approach, the encoder sends the position of a pulse that it is used for the resynchronization of the adaptive codebook, so that propagation errors can be prevented. At the decoder, the amplitude of the resynchronization pulse is estimated by means of minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of the received parameters and the pulse amplitude. The proposal is tested employing PESQ scores and AMR 12.2 kbps, a well-known CELP codec. The results show that, with a very small additional information (350 bps), this technique achieves a noticeable improvement over the results obtained by the packet loss concealment included in the legacy codec.\n",

The procedure jointly provides speech enhancement and high-quality low-rate speech encoding with a flexible rate of just below 1.5 kbits/sec in average. In this paper we are presenting a significant improvement of the original approach that fosters intelligibility in lower SNR environments. We are proposing to augment the originally solely HMM based analysis stage with a discriminative training algorithm that dramatically improves the accuracy of the employed inventory frame selection process.

We first apply sparse coding to the pitch-synchronously analyzed log-spectra. Based on the approximation of the resulting basis, we set a sub-band basis using 1-cycle sinusoidal shapes that have mel-scale for lower frequencies and equally spaced scale for higher frequencies. Parameter of SBM of the log spectrum and the phase spectrum is calculated by fitting the basis to the spectrum. Since the parameter represents the shape of the spectrum, it can be used for frequency warping and filtering based voice adaptation for unit-fusion based TTS. Experimental results show that the analysis synthesis speech is close to original speech and that there are no significant difference between the synthetic speech using analysis-synthesis database and those using original database for unit-fusion based TTS.\n",

    "We address the problem of robust formant tracking in continuous speech. We propose the robust statistical model of t-distribution mixture density (tMM) operating on the \"pyknogram\" obtained through a multiband AM-FM demodulation technique. The statistical model of the pyknogram is shown to be more-effective to handle the variability in the signal processing stage. The t-mixture density estimation is shown to be effective than Gaussian mixture density because of outlier data in the pyknogram. For formant tracking, we show that the tMM is better in terms of parameter selection, accuracy, and smoothness of the estimate. We present experimental results on simulated data, real speech sentences, and test the robustness of the proposed MDA-tMM method to additive noise. Comparisons with PRAAT software and a recently-developed adaptive filterbank technique show that the proposed MDA-tMM method is superior in several aspects.\n",

    "This work demonstrates the use of a modified Kelly-Lochbaum (KL) vocal tract (VT) model in dynamic mapping from speech signals to articulatory configurations. The sixteen section KL model is equipped with a variable length segment for lip rounding and an accurate model for lip radiation impedance. Profiles for the eight Finnish vowels are used to form so called anchor points in the articulatory and spectral domain. These profiles are modulated by cosine functions to produce clusters of vowel variants around the anchor points. The resulting profile and formant frequency data are stored in a codebook that is used in the trajectory estimation task, proposing a number of profile candidates for each speech frame based on the observed formant frequencies. The final trajectory is estimated by minimizing the articulatory distance across all frames. The first trajectory estimation results are promising and in good balance with the present phonetic literature.\n",

    "Motivated by the human auditory system, a feature extraction method for automatic speech recognition (ASR) based on the differential processing strategy of the AVCN, PVCN and the DCN of the cochlear nucleus is proposed. The method utilizes a zero-crossing with peak amplitudes (ZCPA) auditory model as synchrony detector to discriminate the low frequency formants. It utilizes the mean rate information in the synapse processing to capture the very rapidly changing dynamic nature of speech. Additionally, a temporal companding method is utilized for spectral enhancement through two-tone suppression. We propose to separate synchrony detection from synaptic processing as observed in the parallel processing methodology in the cochlear nucleus. HMM recognition using isolated digits showed improved recognition rates in clean and in non-stationary noise conditions than the existing auditory model.\n",

These STRFs are then used as spectro-temporal filters on spectrograms of speech to extract features for phoneme recognition.

    "Human speech perception is remarkably robust to the effects of reverberation, due in part to mechanisms of perceptual constancy that compensate for the characteristics of the acoustic environment. A computer model of this phenomenon is described, which shows compensation for the effects of reverberation in a word identification task. The presence of reverberation is detected as a change in the mean-to-peak ratio of the simulated auditory nerve response. In turn, this leads to attenuation of peripheral auditory activity, which is achieved through an efferent feedback loop. The computer model provides a qualitative match to a range of perceptual data, suggesting that auditory mechanisms under efferent control might contribute to compensation for reverberation in particular speech identification tasks.\n",

The test uses spoken digit triplets, presented in a range of babble backgrounds and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The performance of a normal hearing (NH) and hearing impaired (HI) listener have been assessed using the test. Both listeners show a fall in performance with decreasing SNR, as well as a decrease in performance with an increase in the number of talkers in the babble background. A physiologically accurate computational auditory model has been tuned to match the NH and HI listeners, allowing their performance in the test to be modelled using a missing data-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. For the NH model we show a good match to the behaviour of the human listener. However, the computer model underestimates the digit test performance of the specific HI listener considered here.\n",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of BCUHA regarding transmission of paralinguistic information. For this purpose, two series of listening experiments were conducted. One is a speakers intention identification experiment, the other is a speaker discrimination experiment. To compare performance of BCUHA to that of air-conduction (AC) and cochlear implant, both experiments were conducted under three conditions; BCUHA, AC, and cochlear implant simulator (CIsim). The results show that BCUHA can transmit intentions of speaker as well as CIsim. Also BCUHA can transmit speaker information better than CIsim.\n",

This approach is evaluated on a large database of speech recognition results from normal-hearing and sensorineural hearing-impaired listeners. Individual audiometric thresholds are accounted for by implementing a spectrally-shaped hearing threshold simulating noise. Furthermore, a comparative challenge between the microscopic model and the macroscopic Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) is performed using the same listeners data. The results are that both models show similar correlations of modeled Speech Reception Thresholds (SRTs) to observed SRTs.\n",

The evaluation of this new German speech material was performed by presenting each sentence at three different SNRs to 36 normally hearing listeners. Sentence specific discrimination functions were calculated and for each sentence type 40 sentences were selected. Differences of up to 3dB occurred for the different grades of linguistic complexity. Interindividual differences occurred in speech recognition rates of up to 30%. Thus, the material on the one hand seems to be appropriate for examining the influence of sentence complexity on speech recognition both qualitatively as well as quantitatively. On the other hand the OLACS might be used for diagnostic purposes to differentiate e.g. across individual listeners.\n",

Intelligibility scores vary with the efficiency of the energetic masking while the linguistic content of the message and listeners cognitive performances add to the general incertitude that peaks for the case of masking speech. The present contribution proposes a signal-based assessment of the energetic masking at the sentence level. A mapping onto the scale of the speech intelligibility index is established for stationary noise. Predictions are quantitatively compared with the results of an intelligibility test for speech-modulated noise. The model is independent of voices similarities and semantic features, two important sources of informational masking.\n",

Furthermore, this amplitude effect was observed even when frequency separation of the neighboring formants was greater than 3.5 Bark.

The optimum cluster labeling is achieved by means of the Hungarian algorithm, traditionally used to solve any optimization assignment problem. Finally, the augmented labeled set is applied to train a SVM classifier. This semi-supervised approach has been compared to a fully supervised version, in which the initial labeled sets are directly used to train the SVM model.\n",

    "Supervised methods for extractive speech summarization require a large training set. Summary annotation is often expensive and time consuming. In this paper, we exploit semi-supervised approaches to leverage unlabeled data. In particular, we investigate co-training for the task of extractive meeting summarization. Compared with text summarization, speech summarization task has its unique characteristic in that the features naturally split into two sets: textual features and prosodic/acoustic features. Such characteristic makes co-training an appropriate approach for semi-supervised speech summarization. Our experiments on the ICSI meeting corpus show that by utilizing the unlabeled data, co-training significantly improves summarization performance when only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n",

    "Concept classifiers have been used in speech to speech translation systems. Their effectiveness, however, depends on the size of the domain that they cover. The main bottleneck in expanding the classifier domain is the degradation in accuracy as the number of classes increase. Here we introduce a hierarchical classification process that aims to scale up the domain without compromising the accuracy. We propose to exploit the categorical associations that naturally appear in the training data to split the domain into sub-domains with fewer classes. We use two methods of language model based classification and topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation to use the discourse information for sub-domain detection. The classification task is performed in two steps. First the best category for the discourse is detected using one of the above methods. Then a sub-domain classifier--limited to that category--is deployed. Empirical results from our experiments show higher accuracy for the proposed method compared to a single layered classifier.\n",

    "The development of a speech translation (ST) system is costly, largely because it is expensive to collect parallel data. A new language pair is typically only considered in the aftermath of an international crisis that incurs a major need of cross-lingual communication. Urgency justifies the deployment of interpreters while data is being collected. In recent work, we have shown that audio recordings of interpreter-mediated communication can present a low-cost data resource for the rapid development of automatic text and speech translation. However, our previous experiments remain limited to English/Spanish simultaneous interpretation. In this work, we examine our approaches for exploiting interpretation audio as translation model training data in the context of English/Pashto consecutive interpretation. We show that our previously made findings remain valid, despite the more complex language pair and the additional challenges introduced by the strong resource-limitations of Pashto.\n",

In this paper we present an empirical investigation of the merits of the approach for combining a large number of alignments (more than 200 in total before pruning). The results of the study suggest that the algorithm can often improve the performance of speech to speech translation systems for low resource languages.\n",

    "Deployed Spoken Dialog Systems (SDS) evolve quickly while new services are added or dropped, and while users' behavior change. This dynamic aspect of SDS justify the need for a process allowing the system to keep up to date the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and the Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) models in order to take into account this variability. This process usually consists in collecting new data from the deployed system, trancribing and annotating them, then adding these new examples to the ASR and SLU training corpora in order to retrain the models. This strategy, even when used with an active learning scheme, is costly as the transcription and annotation processes of the new collected samples has to be done manually. Because of this cost the models can't be adapted on a daily bases and the SDS remain unchanged between two revisions. This paper proposes a supervised approach for updating the SLU models of a deployed SDS which doesn't need any additional manual transcription or annotation processes. The limited supervision needed for this alternative approach is given by the users calling the SDS: each user can be seen as a partial Oracle who could confirm if a system prediction is right or wrong. We will illustrate on a real deployed SDS the efficiency of this cost-free method for the online adaptation of an SLU model.\n",

Specifically, the paper evaluates the role of language models built from fluent and disfluent data in quantifying the fluency of a spoken monologue. We show that features based on relative perplexities of the fluent and the disfluent language models on a given utterance are indicative of the level of spoken fluency of the utterance. The proposed features lead to a spoken fluency classification accuracy of 39.8% for 4-class and 68.4% for 2-class classification. Combining these features with a set of prosodic features leads to further improvement in the classification accuracy thus highlighting the complementarity of the information they contribute compared to the low-level disfluency information captured by the prosodic features.\n",

    "In this paper, we focus on inferring social roles in conversations using information extracted only from the speaking styles of the speakers. We use dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to model the turn-taking behavior of the speakers. DBNs provide the capability of naturally formulating the dependencies between random variables. Specifically, we first model our problem as a hidden Markov model (HMM). As it turns out, the knowledge of the segments that belong to the same speaker can be augmented into this HMMstructure to form a DBN. This information places a constraint on two subsequent speaker roles such that the current speaker role depends not only on the previous speakers role but also on that most recent role assigned to the same speaker. We conducted an experimental study to compare these two modeling approaches using broadcast shows. In our experiments, the approach with the constraint on same speaker segments assigned 89.9% turns the correct role whereas the HMM-based approach assigned 79.2% of turns their correct role.\n",

    "The performance of phrase-based SMT systems is crucially dependent on the quality of the extracted phrase pairs, which is in turn a function of word alignment quality. Data sparsity, an inherent problem in SMT even with large training corpora, has an adverse impact on the reliability of the extracted phrase translation pairs. We present a novel feature based on bootstrap resampling of the training corpus, termed phrase alignment confidence, that measures the goodness of a phrase translation pair. We integrate this feature within a phrase-based SMT system and show an improvement of 1.7% BLEU and 4.4% METEOR over a baseline English-to-Pashto (E2P) SMT system that does not use any measure of phrase pair quality. We then show that the proposed measure compares well to an existing indicator of phrase pair reliability, the lexical smoothing probability. We also demonstrate that combining the two measures leads to a further improvement of 0.4% BLEU and 0.3% METEOR on the E2P system.\n",

We observed evidence of frame-attunement using a measure of speech density which takes the ratio of speech to non-speech behaviour per utterance. We noted a synchrony of utterance timing and modelled this using the ESN. The system was trained on a subset of data from 100 telephone conversations from the 1,500-hour JST Expressive Speech Processing corpus, and predicts the interlocutor's timing behaviour with an error-rate of less than 15% based on one partner's speech-activity alone.

Most previous research has focused on F0 and energy variation as resources for turn competition; here, we investigate the relevance of speech rate, pausing and the duration of in-overlap talk. These features are extracted from a set of overlaps drawn from the ICSI Meetings Corpus, and used to derive decision trees that classify overlapping talk as competitive or non-competitive. The decision trees show that both pausing and the duration of the in-overlap speech are significantly related to turn competition for both overlappers and overlappees. Additionally, speech rate is used by overlappees to return competition upon a turn competitive incoming. These findings partially support and extend the observations made in previous studies within the framework of conversation analysis and interactional phonetics.\n",

    "Longitudinal changes were investigated for selected voice source parameters: fundamental frequency (F0), jitter (period perturbation quotient, PPQ), shimmer (amplitude perturbation quotient, APQ) and glottal noise (normalized noise energy, NNE). Acoustic analyses were made on the sustained phonation of the Japanese vowel /a/ of 20 males and 38 females with no laryngeal disease, which were recorded over periods ranging from 10 to 18 years. The longitudinal change of the parameters was evaluated by the statistical t-test, revealing that: 1) strong individuality existed for significant longitudinal changes in the acoustic parameters, 2) F0 falling is a more typical tendency of vocal aging of females than males, while F0 rising, which has been pointed out in the previous reports for males, was not found, 3) shimmer is a more observable indication of vocal aging than jitter, and 4) glottal noise in a high-frequency region tends to increase with aging.\n",

    "The objective of the presentation is to report experiments involving the automatic classification of disordered connected speech into binary (normal, pathological) or multiple (modal, moderately hoarse, severely hoarse) categories. The multi-category classification according to the perceived degree of hoarseness is considered to be clinically meaningful and desirable given that the reliable perceptual classification by humans of disordered voice stimuli is known to be difficult and time-consuming. The acoustic cues are temporal signal-to-dysperiodicity ratios as well as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. The classifiers are support vector machines which have been trained and tested on two connected speech corpora. The binary classification accuracy has been high (98%) for both sets of acoustic cues. The multi-category classification accuracy has been 70% when based on signal-to-dysperiodicity ratios and 59% when based on mel-frequency cepstral coefficients.\n",

Acoustic analyses of fundamental frequency (average F0, F0 range and F0 envelop), intensity (average intensity, intensity range and intensity envelop) and speech rate (number of syllable per second) were conducted to investigate the effect of PD on intonation marking. The results showed that the dysarthric and non-dysarthric speakers differed significantly in all F0 measures, with higher average F0 and reduced F0 variability noted for the PD speakers. Although the PD speakers were more monotonous in prosody, they showed similar intonation contrasts between intonations as in non-dysarthric speakers.\n",

The system fulfills all requirements of the diarization task, i.e. it does not need any a-priori information about the input, including no specific speaker models. After an initialization phase the approach allows a low-latency decision on the current speaker with an accuracy that is close to the underlying offline diarization system. The article describes the approach, evaluates the robustness of the system, and analyzes the latency/accuracy trade-off.\n",

    "System combination or fusion is a popular, successful and sometimes straightforward means of improving performance in many fields of statistical pattern classification, including speech and speaker recognition. Whilst there is significant work in the literature which aims to improve speaker diarization performance by combining multiple feature streams, there is little work which aims to combine the outputs of multiple systems. This paper reports our first attempts to combine the outputs of two state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems, namely ICSI's bottom-up and LIA-EURECOM's top-down systems. We show that a cluster matching procedure reliably identifies corresponding speaker clusters in the two system outputs and that, when they are used in a new realignment and resegmentation stage, the combination leads to relative improvements of 13% and 7% DER on independent development and evaluation sets.\n",

    "Most speaker diarization systems fit into one of two categories: bottom-up or top-down. Bottom-up systems are the most popular but can sometimes suffer from instability from merging and stopping criteria difficulties. Top-down systems deliver competitive results but are particularly prone to poor model initialization which often leads to large variations in performance. This paper presents a new integrated bottom-up/top-down approach to speaker diarization which aims to harness the strengths of each system and thus to improve performance and stability. In contrast to previous work, here the two systems are fused at the heart of the segmentation and clustering stage. Experimental results show improvements in speaker diarization performance for both meeting and TV-show domain data indicating increased intra and inter-domain stability. On the TV-show data in particular, an average relative improvement of 26% DER is obtained.\n",

This paper extends our previous work on information bottleneck diarization aiming to include large number of features besides MFCC and TDOA while keeping computational costs low. At first HMM/GMM and IB systems are compared in case of two and four feature streams and analysis of errors is performed. Results on a dataset of 17 meetings show that, in spite of comparable oracle performances, the IB system is more robust to feature weight variations. Then a sequential optimization is introduced that further improves the speaker error by 5-8% relative. In the last part, computational issues are discussed. The proposed approach is significantly faster and its complexity marginally grows with the number of feature streams running in 0.75% real time even with four streams achieving a speaker error equal to 6%.\n",

We measured both mutual information and canonical correlation on different sets of audio and video features. As acoustic features we considered energy and MFCCs. As visual features we experimented both with motion intensity features, computed on the whole image, and Kanade Lucas Tomasi motion estimation. Thanks to KLT we decomposed the motion in its horizontal and vertical components. The vertical component was found to be more reliable for speech synchrony estimation. The mutual information between acoustic energy and KLT vertical motion of skin pixels, not only resulted in a 20% relative improvement over a MFCC only diarisation system, but also outperformed visual features such as motion intensities and head poses.\n",

    "In this paper, we improve our previous cluster model selection method for agglomerative hierarchical speaker clustering (AHSC) based on incremental Gaussian mixture models (iGMMs). In the previous work, we measured the likelihood of all the data points in a given cluster for each mixture component of the GMM modeling the cluster. Then, we selected the N-best component Gaussians with the highest likelihoods to make the GMM refined for the purpose of better cluster representation. N was chosen empirically then, but it is hard to set an optimal N universally in general. In this work, we propose an improved method to adaptively select component Gaussians from the GMM considered, by measuring the degree of representativeness of each Gaussian component, which we define in this paper. Experiments on two data sets including 17 meeting speech excerpts verify that the proposed approach improves the overall clustering performance by approximately 20% and 10% (relative), respectively, compared to the previous method.\n",

In this paper a modification of the BIC algorithm is presented, which will reduce remarkably the number of deletions without causing an increase in the number of false alarms. This modification, referred to as MultiBIC, assumes that two change-points are present in a window of data, while conventional BIC approach supposes that there is just one. This causes the system to notice when there is more than one change-point in a window, finding shorter segments than traditional BIC.\n",

    "Anticipatory coarticulation provides a basis for the observed asynchrony between the acoustic and visual onsets of phones in certain linguistic contexts and is typically not explicitly modeled in audio-visual speech models. We study within-word audio-visual asynchrony using hand labeled words in which theory suggests that asynchrony should occur, and show that these labels confirm the theory. We introduce a new statistical model of AV speech, the asynchrony-dependent transition (ADT) model that allows asynchrony between AV states within word boundaries, where the state transitions depend on the instantaneous asynchrony as well as the modality's state. This model outperforms a baseline synchronous model in mimicking the hand labels in a forced alignment task, and its behavior as parameters are changed conforms to our expectations about anticipatory coarticulation. The same model could be used for ASR, although here we consider it for the task of forced alignment for linguistic analysis.\n",

    "This paper presents our recent advances in speech recognition based on surface electromyography (EMG). This technology allows for Silent Speech Interfaces since EMG captures the electrical potentials of the human articulatory muscles rather than the acoustic speech signal. Our earlier experiments have shown that the EMG signal is greatly impacted by the mode of speaking. In this study we extend this line of research by comparing EMG signals from audible, whispered, and silent speaking mode. We distinguish between phonetic features like consonants and vowels and show that the lack of acoustic feedback in silent speech implies an increased focus on somatosensoric feedback, which is visible in the EMG signal. Based on this analysis we develop a spectral mapping method to compensate for these differences. Finally, we apply the spectral mapping to the front-end of our speech recognition system and show that recognition rates on silent speech improve by up to 11.59% relative.\n",

    "In this paper, these problems of how to model and train Mandarin prosody dependent acoustic model and how to decode input speech based on prosody dependent speech recognition system will be discussed. We use automatic prosody labeling methods to annotate syllable prosodic break type and stress type on continuous speech corpus, and utilize our proposed methods to train prosody dependent tonal syllable model aiming at data sparse problem after prosody labeling. In this paper, we also utilize MSD-HSMM to model pitch, duration etc. influence factors of prosody, and at the same time, we unite MSD-HSMM model, prosody dependent tonal syllable duration model based on GMM and syntactical prosody model based on Maximum Entropy to decode. When compared with the baseline system, the performance of our prosody dependent speech recognition systems improves the correct rate of tonal syllable significantly.\n",

    "This paper proposes a novel speech recognition method combining Audio-Visual Voice Activity Detection (AVVAD) and Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (AVASR). AVASR has been developed to enhance the robustness of ASR in noisy environments, using visual information in addition to acoustic features. Similarly, AVVAD increases the precision of VAD in noisy conditions, which detects presence of speech from an audio signal. In our approach, AVVAD is conducted as a preprocessing followed by an AVASR system, making a significantly robust speech recognizer. To evaluate the proposed system, recognition experiments were conducted using noisy audio-visual data, testing several AVVAD approaches. Then it is found that the proposed AVASR system using the model-free feature-fusion AVVAD method outperforms not only non-VAD audio-only ASR but also conventional AVASR.\n",

    "Robustness of speech recognition can be significantly improved by multi-stream and especially audiovisual speech recognition, which is of interest e.g. for human-machine interaction in noisy and reverberant environments. The most robust implementations of audiovisual speech recognition often utilize Coupled Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs), which allow for both modalities to be asynchronous to a certain degree. In contrast to conventional speech recognition, this increases the search space significantly, so current implementations of CHMM systems are often not real-time capable. Thus, in order to obtain responsive multi-modal interfaces, using current processing capabilities is vital. This paper describes how general purpose graphics processors can be used to obtain a real-time implementation of audiovisual and multi-stream speech recognition. The design has been integrated both with a WFST-decoder and a token passing system, leading to a maximum speedup factor of 32 and 25, respectively.\n",

We implement a prototype ASR system based on the proposed two-layered AV integration and evaluated the system in dynamically-changing situations where audio and/or visual information can be noisy or missing.

    "Non-Audible Murmur (NAM) is an unvoiced speech signal that can be received through the body tissue with the use of special acoustic sensors (i.e., NAM microphones) attached behind the talker's ear. In a NAM microphone, body transmission and loss of lip radiation act as a low-pass filter. Consequently, higher frequency components are attenuated in a NAM signal. Owing to such factors as spectral reduction, the unvoiced nature of NAM, and the type of articulation, the NAM sounds become similar, thereby causing a larger number of confusions in comparison to normal speech. In the present article, the visual information extracted from the talker's facial movements is fused with NAM speech using three fusion methods, and phoneme classification experiments are conducted. The experimental results reveal a significant improvement when both fused NAM speech and facial information are used.\n",

More precisely, we first report on the impact of the so-called {it acoustic scale factor} on the system accuracy when using lattice-based training, and then we report on the use of n-gram cutoff and pruning techniques. Several system configurations are explored, such as the use of context-independent and context-dependent phone models, the use of single-best phone hypotheses versus phone lattices, and the use of various n-gram orders. Experiments are conducted using the LRE 2007 evaluation data and the results are reported using the a posteriori EER. The results show that the impact of these techniques on the system accuracy is highly dependent on the training conditions and that careful optimization can lead to performance improvements.\n",

    "In the spoken language recognition approach of modeling phonetic lattice with the Support Vector Machine (SVM), term weighting on the supervector of N-gram probabilities is critical to the recognition performance because the weighting prevents the SVM kernel from being dominated by a few large probabilities. We investigate several term weighting functions that are used in text retrieval, which can incorporate the long-term semantic modeling in the short-term N-gram modeling. The functions are evaluated on the NIST 2007 Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) task. Results suggest the term weighting with redundancy of term frequency (rd) which eliminates the redundancy of unit frequency co-occurrence across languages, and the combination of rd and logtf which demonstrates the effectiveness of combining the local and global weighting functions.\n",

    "This paper expands a previously proposed universal acoustic characterization approach to spoken language identification (LID) by studying different ways of modeling attributes to improve language recognition. The motivation is to describe any spoken language with a common set of fundamental units. Thus, a spoken utterance is first tokenized into a sequence of universal attributes. Then a vector space modeling approach delivers the final LID decision. Context-dependent attribute models are now used to better capture spectral and temporal characteristics. Also, an approach to expand the set of attributes to increase the acoustic resolution is studied. Our experiments show that the tokenization accuracy positively affects LID results by producing a 2.8% absolute improvement over our previous 30-second NIST 2003 performance. This result also compares favorably with the best results on the same task known by the authors when the tokenizers are trained on language-dependent OGI-TS data.\n",

    "Automatic language identification (LID) systems generally exploit acoustic knowledge, possibly enriched by explicit language specific phonotactic or lexical constraints. This paper investigates a new LID approach based on hierarchical multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers, where the first layer is a ``universal phoneme set MLP classifier''. The resulting (multilingual) phoneme posterior sequence is fed into a second MLP taking a larger temporal context into account. The second MLP can learn/exploit implicitly different types of patterns/information such as confusion between phonemes and/or phonotactics for LID. We investigate the viability of the proposed approach by comparing it against 2 standard approaches which use phonotactic and lexical constraints with the universal phoneme set MLP classifier as emission probability estimator. On SpeechDat(II) datasets of 5 European languages, the proposed approach yields significantly better performance compared to the 2 standard approaches.\n",

    "This paper presents a Bayesian approach for Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based speaker identification. Instead of evaluating the speaker score of a test speech utterance using a single data likelihood over the GMM learned by the point estimation methods according to the maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori criteria, the Bayesian approach evaluates the score using the expectation of the data likelihood over the posterior distribution of the model parameters, which is depicted with Bayesian integration. However, the integration can not be derived analytically. Therefore, we apply Laplace approximation to the derivations. Theoretically, we show that the proposed Bayesian approach is equivalent to the GMM-UBM approach when infinite training data is available for each speaker. The results of speaker identification experiments on the TIMIT corpus show that the proposed Bayesian approach consistently outperforms GMM-UBM under very limited training data conditions.\n",

Our speaker recognition experiment on NIST 2002 yields equal error rates (EERs) of 9.66 % (clean data) and 16.41 % (-10 dB SNR) for the conventional Hamming method and 8.13 % (clean data) and 14.63 % (-10 dB SNR) using multitapers.

    "Robust stochastic modeling of speech is an important issue for the performance of practical applications. The Gaussian mixture model, GMM, is widely used in speaker ID, but its performance would get limited in the presence of unseen noise and distortions. Such noisy data, referred to as out-liers for the original distribution, can be better represented by the use of heavy-tail distributions, such as Students t-distribution. It provides a natural choice in which the heavy-tail can be controlled using the degrees-of-freedom parameter. We explore finite mixture of t-distributions model (tMM), to represent noisy speech data and show its robustness for speaker ID, compared to GMM. Using the TIMIT and NTIMIT databases, the recognition accuracy obtained are 100% and 79.68% with a 34 mixture tMM respectively much better than those reported in the literature.\n",

Since the speaker-specific information of features in each frame changes depending upon the characteristics of speech, it is important to determine the appropriate frame length and rate to extract the salient feature frames. In order to distinctively represent the characteristics of vowels and consonants both in time and frequency domains, we introduce a variable frame length and rate (VFLR) method based on spectral kurtosis, which provides a local measure of time-frequency concentration. Experimental results verify that the proposed VFLR method improves the performance of the speaker verification system on the NIST SRE-06 database by 9.725% (relative) compared to the feature extraction method with the fixed length and rate.\n",

    "In this paper, a maximum a posteriori sound source localization (MAP-SSL) is proposed in reverberant and noisy conditions. Incorporating a sparse prior related to the location of source into the existing maximum likelihood sound source localization (ML-SSL) framework, the proposed MAP-SSL algorithm is derived. In the proposed MAP-SSL algorithm, assuming the direction of an active source to be sparse in the space of all possible finite source directions, when a source is active, the criterion in deriving the proposed MAP-SSL algorithm is similar to the criterion used to derive the existing ML-SSL framework, except that in our criterion a sparse source prior that enforces a sparse source direction solution is added. The sparse source prior plays a key role in improving the SSL performance. The experimental results show the proposed MAP-SSL algorithm outperforms the variants of the ML-SSL framework.\n",

    "This paper proposes a multichannel source separation approach that exploits statistical characteristics of source location cues represented by inter-channel phase differences (IPD) and those of source log spectra represented by hidden Markov models (HMM). With this approach, source separation is achieved by iterating two simple sub-procedures, namely the clustering of the time-frequency (TF) bins into individual sources and the independent updating of the model parameters of each source. An advantage of this approach is that we can update the model parameters of each source independently of those of the other sources in each iteration, and thus the update can be computationally very efficient. We show by simulation experiments that the proposed method can greatly improve, in a computationally efficient manner, the quality of each source signal from sound mixtures in terms of cepstral distortion using an speaker independent HMM composed of very small number of states.\n",

    "Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation plays an important role in binaural hearing systems. Recently methods usually require a large array of microphones or do not adapt special conditions, e.g., humanoid robot with the effect of head-related transfer function. In this paper, we propose a two-microphone DOA estimation algorithm, namely EC-BEAM, which applies equalization-cancellation (EC) model into DOA estimation through beamforming-based technique. Specifically, the EC model is integrated into beamforming to remove the signal components from a given direction and yield the energy of the remained signals from other directions. Through searching several DOA candidates, the true DOA is determined as the direction at which the energy of the remained signals gets to minimum. Experimental results showed that EC-BEAM can not only well adapt to binaural hearing systems but also be able estimate much accurately the DOA of target signal in various noise conditions with only two microphones.\n",

    "Accurate, microphone-based speaker localization in real-world environments, like office spaces or meeting rooms, must be able to track a single speaker and multiple concurrent speakers in the presence of reverberations and background noise. Our Multiband Joint Position-Pitch (M-PoPi) algorithm for circular microphone arrays already shows a frame-wise localization estimation score of about 95% for tracking a single speaker in a noisy, reverberant setting. In this paper, we present two extensions of the M-PoPi algorithm to improve the localization estimation accuracy also for multiple concurrent speakers. These extensions are a weighted spectro-temporal fragment analysis as a pre-processing step for the M-PoPi algorithm and a particle filter-based tracking as a post-processing step. Experiments using real-world recordings of two concurrent speakers in a typically reverberant meeting room show an improvement of the frame-wise localization estimation score from 43% using the plain M-PoPi algorithm to 66% using the M-PoPi algorithm with both extensions.\n",

    "We propose a new catalog-based speech-music separation method for background music removal. Assuming that we know a catalog of the background music, we develop a generative model for the superposed speech and music spectrograms. We represent the speech spectrogram by a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) model and the music spectrogram by a conditional Poisson Mixture Model (PMM). By choosing the size of the catalog, i.e., the number of mixture components we can tradeoff speed versus accuracy. The combined hierarchical model leads to a mixture of multinomial distributions as the joint posterior of music and speech. Separation and hyper-parameter adaptation can be achieved via an Expectation Maximization algorithm. Experimental results show that separation performance of the algorithm is promising. Furthermore, we show that incorporating prior information such as volume adjustment parameter can enhance the separation performance.\n",

We propose a CASA based approach to segregate unvoiced speech from nonspeech interference. As unvoiced speech does not contain periodic signals, we first remove the periodic portions of a mixture including voiced speech. With periodic components removed, the remaining interference becomes more stationary. We estimate the noise energy in unvoiced intervals on the basis of segregated voiced speech. Spectral subtraction is employed to extract time-frequency segments in unvoiced intervals, and we group the segments dominated by unvoiced speech by simple thresholding or Bayesian classification. Systematic evaluation and comparison show that the proposed method considerably improves the unvoiced speech segregation performance under various SNR conditions.\n",

    "The problem of sequential organization in the cochannel speech situation has previously been studied using speaker-model based methods. A major limitation of these methods is that they require the availability of pretrained speaker models and prior knowledge (or detection) of participating speakers. We propose an unsupervised clustering approach to cochannel speech sequential organization. Given enhanced cepstral features, we search for the optimal assignment of simultaneous speech streams by maximizing the between- and within-cluster scatter matrix ratio penalized by concurrent pitches within individual speakers. A genetic algorithm is employed to speed up the search. Our method does not require trained speaker models, and experiments with both ideal and estimated simultaneous streams show the proposed method outperforms a speaker-model based method in both speech segregation and computational efficiency.\n",

In order to capture contextual information, we combine the systems hypothesis for the previous turn with the current one. Our ?nal system uses a multi-level fusion method for this task. Each fusion step uses different information such as acoustic and lexical cues, contextual information, or hypotheses from different classi?ers.

For the Affect Sub-Challenge we propose a modeling schema where a universal background model is ?rst trained an all the training data and then, employing the maximum a posteriori estimation criteria, a new fea- ture vector of means is produced for each particular sample. The feature set used is comprised of low level descriptors from the baseline system, which in our case are split into four subsets, and modeled by its own model. Predictions from all subsystems are fused using the sum rule fusion. Aside from the baseline regression procedure, we also evaluated the Support Vector Regression and compared the performance. Both systems achieve higher recognition results on the development set compared to baseline, but in the Affect Sub-Challenge our systems cross correlation is lower than that of the baseline system, although the mean linear error is slightly superior.

    "This paper focuses on the automatic recognition of a persons age and gender based only on his or her voice. Up to five different systems are compared and combined in different con?gurations: three systems model the speakers characteristics in different feature spaces, i.e., MFCC, PLP, TRAPS, by Gaussian mixture models. The features of these systems are the concatenated mean vectors. System number 4 uses a physical two-mass vocal model and estimates in a data-driven optimization procedure 9 glottal features from voiced speech sections. For each utterance the minimum, maximum and mean vectors form a 27-dimensional feature vector. The last system calculates a 219-dimensional prosodic feature set for each utterance based on voice and unvoiced speech segments. We compare two different ways to fuse the different systems: First, we concatenate the system on feature level. The second way of combination is performed on score level by multi-class logistic regression. Despite there are just minor differences between the two approaches, late fusion is slightly superior. On the development set of the Interspeech Agender challenge we achieved an unweighted recall of 46.1% with early fusion and 47.8% with late fusion.\n",

    "Car manufacturers are faced with a new challenge. While a new generation of digital natives becomes a new customer group, the problem of aging society is still increasing. This emphasizes the need of providing ?exible in-car dialog that take into account the speci?c needs and preferences of the respective user (group). Along the lines of this years Interspeech motto Spoken Language Processing for All, we address the question how we ?nd out which group the current user belongs to. We present a GMM/SVM-supervector system (Gaussian MixtureModel combined with Support VectorMachine) for speaker age and gender recognition, a technique that is adopted from state-of-the-art speaker recognition research. We furthermore describe an experimental study with the aim to evaluate the performance of the system as well as to explore the selection of parameters.\n",

    "This paper derived four acoustic parameters reflecting voice quality improvement by voice training. Voice training corrects respiration, phonation, articulation, and facial expression. The purpose of this study is to develop acoustic parameters which quantitatively represent the quality of each training item. This paper examined six acoustical feature parameters on the performance as the measure for voice quality improvement. Experimental results indicated that four of the six parameters, the intensity of harmonic structure, the dynamic range of the spectral envelope, formant intensity, and spectral slope were significantly improved after the training. Further analyses were carried out on the correlation between subjective evaluation and above acoustic properties. The results indicated that abdominal respiration was most important for improving these four parameters.\n",

    "When analyzing singing voice signal, it is required to know the boundaries of each phonetic unit in the singing voice samples. However, due to prolonged vowels in the singing voice, it is not easy to accurately align a singing voice with the phonetic sequence of its lyrics by conventional speech recognition approach. This paper proposes a solution for the phonetic annotation of the singing voice with the provision of a MIDI file and a parallel speech recording of the lyrics. The MIDI file consisting of notation and lyric information is used to locate lyrics in the singing voice. The recording of parallel speech data is used to generate a reference phonetic annotation by forced aligning it with lyrics with a speech recognizer. The singing voice is then aligned with the speech, which has phonetic annotation, and the phonetic boundaries are mapped to the singing voice. The result shows that we are able to get an accurate annotation of phonetic boundaries in singing voice.\n",

In this system, singing expression parameters consisting of melody and dynamics which are derived from F0 and power are modeled by context-dependent Hidden Markov Models (HMMs.) A modeling method of the parameters are optimized for dealing with them. Since parameters we focus on are essential but general ones for singing synthesizers, generated parameters from the trained models may be possible to be applied to many of them. In the experiment, we trained singing style models by using singing recording with much expressive style, then parameters were generated for songs not included in training data and actually applied to our singing synthesizer VOCALOID. As a result, the style was well perceived in the synthesized sound with good synthetic quality.\n",

    "This paper proposes an algorithm to estimate the melody pitch line (the most dominant pitch sequence) of a given polyphonic audio based on melody range estimation and pitch candidate extraction using a harmonic structure model similar to that proposed by Goto. This paper defines melody pitch candidate as a list of pitch candidates that produces the best-fit harmonic models to the polyphonic audio. In many melody extraction algorithms proposed in the past, multiple-pitch extractor (MPE) is often performed for extracting melody pitch candidates; however, the MPE serves the purpose of estimating all pitches within a frame of a polyphonic audio and does not necessarily provide melody pitch candidates. The estimated weights of the harmonic structure model which must be obtained for extracting the pitch candidates are liable to octave error and strong low frequency interference, and therefore, certain refinement after the estimation must be performed. As a refinement, the algorithm measures the degree of harmonic fitness of each candidate. Furthermore, a melody pitch range is estimated to reduce false-positive pitch candidates. The melody pitch range is estimated based on the distribution of the best pitch candidates with long duration. Experimental results show that the proposed extraction algorithm performed better than many of the algorithms proposed in the past.\n",

The proposed scheme perfectly removes a vocal object using harmonic information of the vocal object.

    "All normal humans can acquire native phoneme systems naturally. However, it is unclear as to how infants learn the acoustic expression of each phoneme of their languages. In recent studies, researchers have inspected phoneme acquisition by using a computational model. However these studies have used a reading speech that has a limited vocabulary as input and do not handle a continuous speech. Therefore, we use a natural speech and build a self-organization model that simulates the cognitive ability, and we analyze the information that is necessary for the acquisition of the native vowels. Our model is designed to learn a natural continuation utterance and to estimate the number and boundaries of the vowel categories. In the simulation trial, we investigate the relationship between the quantity of learning and the accuracy for the vowels in a single Japanese speakers speech. As a result, it is found that the vowel recognition rate of our model is comparable to that of an adult.\n",

This model, developed in the ACORNS project, has shown to be able to learn word-like units from stimuli in which utterances are paired with visual information. In this paper we extend the ACORNS experiments to ambiguous stimuli, as to obtain a computational correlate of the findings by Smith and Yu in 2008. Smith and Yu stipulate that a young infant is confronted with an uncertainty problem, how to pair a word, embedded in a sentence, and a referent, embedded in a rich visual scene. They show that young infants can resolve the uncertainty problem by evaluating the statistical evidence across many individually ambiguous words and scenes. We investigate to what extent the ACORNS model is able to deal with cross-modal ambiguity. Moreover, we show the positive effect of an 'active' role during learning when confronted with ambiguity, based on internal confidence.\n",

    "This paper presents a method for improving the readability of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) results for classroom lectures. Most of the previous research on improving the readability of recognition results focused mainly on manually transcribed texts, and not ASR results. Due to the presence of a large number of domain-dependent words and the casual presentation style, even state-of-the-art recognizers yield a 30-50% word error rate for speech in classroom lectures. Thus, a method for improving the readability of ASR results needs to be robust against recognition errors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for improving the readability based on a machine translation model that uses a confusion network representing multiple hypotheses of the ASR results to achieve robustness against recognition errors. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in both automatic and manual evaluations.\n",

    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to statistical model-based voice activity detection (VAD) that incorporates a second-order conditional maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. As a technical improvement for the first-order conditional MAP criterion in, we consider both the current observation and the voice activity decision in the previous two frames to take full consideration of the inter-frame correlation of voice activity. The soft decision scheme is incorporated to result in time-varying thresholds for further performance improvement. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional CMAP-based VAD technique under various experimental conditions.\n",

    "Traditional Voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms are applied in a linear transformed space without any constraint. As a result, the VAD algorithms are not robust to noise interference. Considering the special characteristics of speech, we proposed a new speech feature extraction method by giving constraints on the processing space as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In the RKHS, we regarded the speech estimation as a functional approximation problem. Under this framework, we could incorporate the nonlinear mapping functions in the approximation implicitly via a kernel function. The approximation function could capture the nonlinear and high-order statistical regularities of the speech. Our VAD algorithm is designed on the basis of the power energy in this regularized RKHS. Compared with a baseline and G.729B VAD algorithms, experimental results showed the promising advantages of our proposed algorithm.\n",

    "This paper presents a new voice activity detection (VAD) framework that is based on the empirical rules and statistical models. First, the VAD framework detects the candidate endpoints efficiently in the time domain with empirical rules which are based on the human knowledge and the nature of the speech continuousness, and then it confirms the candidate endpoints in the transform domain with different confirmation schemes for beginning-point and ending-point. Particularly in the transform domain, a new algorithm called sliding-window double-layer confirmation (SWDC) is proposed and employed to confirm the endpoint accurately, and sensitive data, which is used for GMM training, are proposed for our detection scheme. The experiments show that the proposed VAD framework achieves better performances in various environmental conditions.\n",

    "This study examines the difficult task of Speech Activity Detection (SAD) in two hostile environments: AM push-to-talk air traffic control and international telephone conversations with very low SNRs. Due to the poor performance of traditional energy-based SAD, two novel approaches to SAD were developed that specifically target spectral characteristics that typify speech, rather than trying to separate out the background, which can vary enormously. As a result these approaches are inherently adaptive to their environments. A Speech Energy Resonance Band Detection approach and a Harmonic Product Spectrum clustering approach to SAD are described in this paper and their performance evaluated against MIT Xtalk and the Teager Energy Operator (TEO) in clean and hostile environments.\n",

    "Crosstalk in a stereo recording occurs when the speech from one participant is leaked into the close-talking microphones of the other participants. This crosstalk causes degradation of the voice activity detection (VAD) performance on individual channels, in spite of the strength of the crosstalk signal being lower than that of the participant's speech. To address this problem, we first detect speech using a standard VAD scheme on the merged signal obtained by adding the signals from two channels and then determine the target channel using a channel selection scheme. Although VAD is performed on a short-term frame basis, we found that the channel selection performance improves with long-term signal information. Experiments using stereo recordings of real conversations demonstrate that the VAD accuracy averaged over both channels improves by 22% (absolute) indicating the robustness of the proposed approach to crosstalk compared to the single channel VAD scheme.\n",

    "This paper proposes a model re-estimation method based on Gaussian pruning for noise robust voice activity detection (VAD). Our previous work, switching Kalman filter-based VAD, sequentially estimates a noise Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and constructs GMMs of observed noisy speech signals by composing pre-trained silence and clean GMMs and noise GMMs. However, the composed models are not optimum models, because they do not reflect the characteristics of the observed signal. To ensure the optimality of the composed models, we investigate a method for re-estimating the composed model. However, since our VAD works under the sequential processing, there are insufficient re-training data for a satisfactory model re-estimation. Thus, we propose a model re-estimation method that involves the extraction of beneficial information using Gaussian pruning. The proposed method re-estimates the model by pruning non-dominant Gaussian distributions for each frame, and improves VAD accuracy in noise.\n",

Voice activities are determined by finding the joint probability of this statistical model as a soft measure.

This background noise corpus was then mixed with speech events chosen from the TIMIT clean speech corpus over a wide variety of noise lengths, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and active speech proportions to form the mixed-speech QUT-NOISE-TIMIT corpus. The evaluation of five baseline VAD systems on the QUT-NOISE-TIMIT corpus is conducted to validate the corpus and show that the variety of noise available will allow for better evaluation of VAD systems than existing approaches in the literature.\n",

    "In this study, the problem of voice activity detection (VAD) is formulated in a Bayesian hypothesis testing framework. Unlike traditional VAD schemes that employ a single statistical model, multiple models are assumed to be potentially engaged with a priori probabilities, due to the statical diversity of the environmental noise degrading the speech. Moreover, the optimal a priori probabilities are explored using discriminative training based method, which is suggested to directly reduce the miss-hit rate and false-alarm rate of the VAD. As shown in the evaluations, VAD performance, both in terms of absolute performance and consistency across a diverse set of noise conditions, can be significantly improved using the proposed Bayesian method.\n",

    "This paper presents a method of voice activity detection (VAD) for high noise scenarios, using a noise robust voiced speech detection feature. The developed method is based on the fusion of two systems. The first system utilises the maximum peak of the normalised time-domain autocorrelation function (MaxPeak). The second system uses a novel combination of cross-correlation and zero-crossing rate of the normalised autocorrelation to approximate a measure of signal pitch and periodicity (CrossCorr) that is hypothesised to be noise robust. The score outputs by the two systems are then merged using weighted sum fusion to create the proposed autocorrelation zero-crossing rate (AZR) VAD. Accuracy of AZR was compared to state-of-the-art and standardised VAD methods and was shown to outperform the best performing system with an average relative improvement of 24.8% in half-total error rate (HTER) on the QUT-NOISE-TIMIT database created using real recordings from high-noise environments.\n",

To achieve good search performance, we need to adapt the GMMs for environmental noise. We describe a new unsupervised on-line GMM adaptation method based on MAP estimation. The robustness of our method is further improved by weighting updating parameters of GMMs according to the confidence measure for the adaptation data. We also describe an approach to accelerate the adaptation by caching statistical values to adapt GMMs. Experimental results show that our adaptive decoding method significantly improves the word accuracy in a noisy environment with only a minor increase in the computational cost.\n",

    "Voice activity detection (VAD) plays an important role on the performance of speech processing systems. Recently, more and more works focused on the statistical model-based voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms have been presented in literature, which make a decision of speech and nonspeech based on the likelihood ratio (LR). However, all the statistical models used in those algorithms are unable to exactly describe the statistics of noisy speech and various type noises. In this paper, a novel VAD algorithm is proposed based on the nonparametric detection theory by incorporating the likelihood ratio into the sign test to provide a new decision rule. Meanwhile, an optimal threshold of the proposed method is derived and the selections of relevant parameters are discussed as well. Experimental results show that the proposed VAD algorithm outperforms the conventional statistical model-based VAD.\n",
